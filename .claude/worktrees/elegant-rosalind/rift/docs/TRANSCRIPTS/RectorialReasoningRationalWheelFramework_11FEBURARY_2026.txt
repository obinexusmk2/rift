-------------------
Today is. Today is on Wednesday. Tuesday. This was the 11th of 26th. I'm not is two 2:59 AM so I'm still not. Venus Ward Ewell Pro. Myself literally doing nothing. It's also a passport. Which one belonging. Me so 52, but we lost 13 from the 13th of. From there yesterday from the. From the 10th turn down 12/13/13 at. 4:42 PM. But you know, that's what it's about. But you know, I have to do something now because for them to find this properly or not working from us. So he must have been a problem. For everyone and anyone. Let's be a friend. So I'm gonna free you guys by using my control model. You know my control model sometimes to go here, but you're gonna stand freedom. Freedom has comes a price like this to them. Freedom has gone with price. You know it's free. That's with the five foot, that's with the task with the five foot, So it comes, the price goes to 5 for it. It's definitely, you know, it's not meant to be that way. The the other people others were working so that I'm saying to you, because we have other ways of working freedom comes up price you shouldn't do you shouldn't do so the pro solution is just to have the inferences never change so. And go to for G2 for I for India I for India Facebook. But I'm brown anyway. I'm trying to make this the baseline, so if you're looking at me kind of don't get detained. All of them economy, but you know, he got detained, but he was fighting. And I don't seem to be able to kill him, but if you know, you know I'm going to kind of people. I don't support him, but I'm not being 10, so I'm in him too called him. I mean into the framework of accessible if you have to buy directional clothes. Buy buy the shots. So, you know, I'm trying to stay for it, but this is police all the time for housing. You know, these are two opposing stories. Like he was he was a freedom fighter, but he was a he was a fragmented fighter. He was like fragment fighting without the legal system to find the system, but it wasn't fighting. You know, in the way I expect him to, you know, But he's no scientist. He's not worth them. We should try to pull up, but you know, scientists regardless. He was rebelling, but the rubble, she was a rebel. But he was rubbling in a kind of his framework was a little thing out there, you know, But it wasn't working out, you know, because he had on people. I want to. Save the security. But don't you guys have weapons? If you can do it. But yeah, I know how this works. I've been doing it. So I was just a child, 14 years old. So you know, I'm proposing here is what I'm saying is theoretical reasoning, rational framework. Here we go, people here. So the rhetoric of regional. This operation bound so Ciggy and November etcetera. I feel equity for Google, G2 for Go. I just get so bad it's over. As a Sarah I for indigo, I for G for golf, I for no. I feel idiot. I feel as, for example, as Sarah I for India, G for golf, I for India, I for India is an operational protocol. Play some blue noise. 'Cause you know some brown noise, 'cause I. Is that I'm a philosopher. But I've been doing this for so long and it doesn't seem to be on doing it. So basically doesn't make sense to how I'm doing that. Well, I use a lot of you know. It is literally a toothbrush, human rights, it's like a Tuca tuberculosis. So these are different things. So the main reasons are again. A1 in think is an operational protocol basically, especially operation, basically it goes operation, arc and reward, you know happening in the world. They don't happen on your computer to you, they happen in the world so. They are it's a big thing. This is going to real world. If the encounter states like, you know, things like ideologies such as racism, you know, into a framework you can formalize things like that into a fruit of this critical encoded all the solar system, you know, like. Suffering, pain, sadness, anger doesn't give me your hand. You need to hold up for you indefinitely, you know by holding that for you. Basically yes, no or minus -1. Me because this is what Stan can mislead us and will mislead us, you know, most likely mislead us, you know, 'cause you don't feel as comprehended and. Factor not to risk. That's what happens in a lot of human rights cases. You know, it's a big thing, you know, So you have to have a clear picture of clear mind. You know, I'm using now this comes on me and I'm not, but that's one because. I've been trained well. I'm not. I'm not our belongings among us and things. Clothes off but somebody that's belong to me so you know, I'm not a rebel. I haven't killed anybody, I haven't got account and I cannot promise can 3 without without proving to speak on crime. Without crime. Cortana, I've never gone wrong, you know, you see, I'm not even have nothing wrong, you know, but I don't have anything to that because I don't know, I don't see how this is like I'm dedication to be careful from this transfer, you know, no matter, it doesn't go wrong, but I mean kind of which I believe, you know, the students did something the theoretical. Political rationale is of human rights. It's a business, It's a business. It keeps you there because. You are you are more or less a slave. But slave I mean. Well, you're successful. You're neither. No, you're more of a more successful labour. You're more of your. The scene is less so, not slavely, not making you work forever. And they can make you forever, you know, because it's something to make you do, to comply to it, and you know. The the dunk is that yeah, I wasn't done for you. Yeah. So you have someone that support like me as soon as rich like any kind of. And you know, the duality is they're born to humans to be validated, you know? So the school is basically the box they hold. So this place is a box and this can hold you. We can hold, hold them. You how do you want to see it? You know you can hold them, you can hold you accountable. You can hold them. So this is good. It's holding, it's holding things for you. While you all did this, what's the peer-to-peer mode over? So hopefully it's a peer-to-peer model. So I'm poor, I'm being detained. He's rich, he's outside. So I'm poor. I'm I'm poor, no money, but I'm in the 10 million team and he's rich. So he's rich. He's rich, you know, because of wealthy when you're outside. So, you know, so Republican must advocate for me any advocacy right now, but I'm not getting advocacy. You know, I keep requesting the same things and keeping myself to find people differently to do it. And I fancy what you do, but they're not being they're not complying with it. Uh, do you tell me where I belong? I don't belong. I don't belong here. I never do. I never will do. But what do you lose him so after the code myself into the framework. I said sort of like a shuttle who's optional like, you know, in need, need to pass over to state it's time, but operations, you know. It looks out for you, the deadline, go look up for you. Because it's a protocol, it's basically allows you to get food. But you know, hopefully you know, have a good view. So it's very important you have advocacy from where you're from. Doesn't matter whether I get transferred to New World or not. The IT carries over. It carries over a session, an Internet session, because you know, the woodwinds are basically. A place to keep you from degrading treatment, you know. 'Cause you know it does work, yes, it does work, but they don't want you to comply with them. And you know that's why 'cause it does work, you know and you are can be chopped off a piece and chopped off. Your hand can be chopped off and you can still disprocession on you because you are there for profit, for profit system and because of fight fire without having fire, that's what obliges. Is a human rights business it's been run so human rights and doesn't know what's been wrong you know and human rights in general you know but our our our authority anybody that came their bear from the student should go human rights you see you know and most of you must catch so you know you know. 'Cause they say the some of the person said don't know what's his name, the one that died recently, the one that was the. On the 1st of February I want to check up. Them he was like that now do you remember? But the Fulani man, I don't know his name is. But he came with the power, but he didn't really know. I have to go and so, well, he's robot, but he, he had a he was a so I'm gonna get elected from for presents for, for tuition. So come so I can build my human rights foundation foundation. I'm doing it because you guys, it's not going to carry now because no one's carrying it. So I'm coming to the burden of. Rebuilding everything as part of the riches of return, basically the peer-to-peer model. So I'm, I'm, I'm powerless. So you see, I'm, I'm powerless, but 'cause I'm in the square, I'm in the square in this, in this, being held in the square in facility. That's what in the square means. So powerless in the square. But I can be powerful outside the squirrel, so I can be rich and powerful also Squirt. No 'cause I'm not being held anymore. I guess. I guess my will. But the thing you gonna stand? Is the the rhetoric? Is that a share that I share? You know I can contain? The reason? Worthy reason worth the kids like you know the fact is the fact of the matter is. That rhetorical business name is that there's There's no reason. To not comply. There's no reason to not give my freedom. There's no reason not to. Because it was a mistake by me too. It was it was a advocacy by me password whose lesser. In the framework of one, because you know. I got put in a box amongst them so soon after the box has to Get Me Out. Let's go to advocacy. But so everyone should have if I'm so if I say until you forget to try them out. So it's about 3 services. So you can have three other scenarios allocating to him on everything and one of the local ones by the service, such as the prior group and the NHS and like you know, and things that should work in their framework and our framework of human rights, thegithub.com. Of oscar before bravo life and income and remember if i could legislation, which is why eating one human rights realization. No, because I made it like I have. It's senses, it senses it senses but I'm saying I'm Tripoli some tribal polar, so I have one I can see my nose won't want to my eyes to my nose to no my eyes warm my nose to my mouth. My ears full, my skin, my torch 5. And that's why i've said to my taste my toast my 5 + 5 minimum is 16. Five and five is 10. Five and five is 25. So for an electrical person that didn't break, deputed for human rights was not enough. It was not enough. So then after the 60 more rats, just for like in case we get into Rome, you know, to know that it's due to going procession, never break it up 'cause you can have you get extra, right? Extra won't be extra right? You know, to define your framework what is wrong. So no, we can really formalize this, you know, if every pathway you go. And for me I have. I was 64. I have 8, so it's minimum. So 5 and some tripolar. So that's the minimum I could have a sense of direction and the kind of being here and now past the future. Presence of here not and there's three people that represents me, which is here and now, but he he resides in the past. You know, he's the human rights in the past. He remembers the past, but as he is human now interested in the present. So, you know, I should be as a, you know, present. 'Cause I'm I'm taking a persona on as Mr. the King leading the way, 'cause I'm here and now. And we'll be eyes in the future, the hearts and souls in the future. But the hot and soak is here now. True to you, but it still seems like a medium natural fit. The pen is as not your sword, which has the pen letters of the sword, you know, but and then Obi owes the house. And so who's your heart? You don't have to hold your heart. You don't have to hold out to keep breathing, you know, but you have to hold. Yourself accountable for what you do. You know, we have to understand. So the rhetoric of the No. There's no reason to give me a reason to hold someone but if I am. I've passed my. I have to come up with today to see whether my work can Get Me Out of here. But you know, I cannot stay here because of the session 52 to my lawyer can only. Give me an unavailable time for. I do like them too, you know when I go to Nigeria, they will serve a testament to me. I'm a tribune. I tribe yourself, you know, be me and do this young 'cause I have a issue. My son so six woman so sex or so. 'Cause I have. 678. Yes, I have. I'm Tripoli. So those are three people in one. So I'm seeing a human rights. So don't know, 'cause it has a fence. It's like for me, me, me, myself and I. I thought saying something else about that, but that's one reason I haven't. But anyway, computer it's it's, it becomes, it doesn't indict it, it sums up to it and it's computable, it's maneuverable by the system always again so. The decision must be encounters must encounter. I don't care whether it's a nasty bug to read it in the what I see the problem has been coded. It's been coded like you know, but is the code using the retrograde. For example, if I go to the gym right now, I commute to you and I was in community, I'm not working some of the validity and I can go to the gym and then and then. To the park to exercise. I don't need I don't need smoking to exercise. I don't just exercise, but the company should be in a gym. So if they if the gym, if the common if the park is public and the park wise to equipment, I usually to come near that, you know. On a Sunday, you know, but you know, if it's not clear when I'll use it in the in the in the close place and indoors place, but it's not a good thing to. Angle stuff this is basically I'm saying that the team come on museum, my ultimate to do stuff, my rest of the stuff, you know, the rest of exercise in the in the in the in the ribbons club and then me being here, being a chain, I have to ask information. You know, it is not the same reality. It's it's no, it's not reason to refuse me. Service which are doing here. But but not, do not do me here. National tuition campaign. They asked me when I was going to the gym. I knew Mr. Jim, but I don't switch. You know, I can't be doing that. Go to gym. If I have to call lawyers, you know, and people, you know, the Russians. There's no reason to give me a session 25. Now give me here for the bill. You see, you see, you have to hold the kind of space you don't see. You don't have to. You can start thinking properly about your way out, you know, but you're gonna have a no advocacy that's gonna have this is probably gonna have advocacy from the. Three networks, we can have one for them. Obviously, if you could attain by by someone outside the Constitution, you have automatically, right. You get a laptop, you get access to feed on the shelter, but you get the quantities. We get to eat what you have to drink when you need to drink what you want. I can go see you about now. The customer was the assessed attention. Oh, oh, oh, but we're not gonna break you out. We're gonna get you out of there. We're gonna get out of them in time. In time, not in space. Still, we're gonna keep you there. We're gonna get you out. That's the problem for progressing on That's going to keep to get people out. They're going to be the team that have no. Actually have no issue with the system placement. I'm going to be working on this until I leave this unit determined unit. I've been working there because it's the best time to work in it, you know? It's like what is the best time to work on it? My computer. But you know it's gonna have you. Ustam that something that you when you're not when you're not 'cause I'm I'm behind the future, who be eyes in the future, you know? But he's him and now he can be him now too. He says we can't even. The future is now. The future is now. The future is now. Here's the future here. See, the future is now. So be I, my third persona I'm Tripoli. So you know, 5673 personal. I have three objects done. To an objective, not subjective to objective share. I can go to places in my with my mind. You know, I'm not daydreaming. I don't Daydream, guys. I'm navigating the system of the robot. I know you're writing. I'm not stuck in my head when I was putting them, but I'm also kind of holding authority. Little hot, suffering, pain, anger. As though they could hear a human being. And I can't listen to my account, you know, but the financially, because it's a humorous protocol, but human protocol has no real point of money to solve the problem. We just keep running out of field, loss of procedure, you know? On a litigation so litigation is the so basically return of the riches is a litigation protocol ensures that you know doesn't matter how long. Do you get money out of the system? Right now it's 3:00 as long as £12 billion. From through council, you know. Three years a month. So 12 billion #2 billion, 12 billion. Doesn't pay for that money. You did it like it's almost. They have to pay their money. To someone to appear for the. And the under the new business control framework, you know, 'cause I didn't mean to throw away and ask them to do my business. No, but business is the human rights the first human rights loan everything is boundary business rebound human sovereignty organization in our conscious to be attempt to empire the social governance so. The buy to sugar will be so you know, if I had some red chicken pole on my box, there's someone on working. I'm working or I'm human right to say I wanna work. I should go to work because that is that's not facing framework of not being allow me to know about my humanism. So Section 2 here is 28 days. But the agency to contribute some atmosphere too. I cannot be honest with you. They cannot put my sister in. They have no crimes. So many people come away from everyone here. Uh, for the time being, but, you know, theoretical is there's a, that's a fact and it's a shift of the lived fact, you know, into the fact, you know, the rhetoric is that, you know, it's a live truth. The Realty to your, the reasoning refers to the dilemma of the problem, you know. Do you see the truth now? What is the reason for no reason is the something that doesn't want to budget. You know, there's something for human rights that this one doesn't want to give him. And the rush no behind it is all money because the woman stands the deeper issue of someone being. But don't don't don't do the wrong way. Do don't do the one too. So you know, 'cause my rights are being violated, so my way has to. To issue me that time but. Private accommod. Give me that my other with him to to free me. But after this I've got some other some sort of my Manisha my card issue. My first resolution oK, let me go and try my, uh, one second guys. I don't know there was a half everything like this power back. There is an optional no court of us. You got a power button so the muco OS and for Mike and for Mike from below K for kilo for Oscar undefinedhumor system and. Power back so everyone that. Microsoft OS Power Bank. Power Bank. It's a big chemical as infamy info is a human rights operating system. And the works of new divergent human rights only operating system is not bound by anything else. No nautical minds because young, you know, musical minds don't see the full picture based on how to design. So it's it has to work on this power bank. So everyone gets a power bank, you know. External power bank you know for the for the micro tablets and allow the devices by going to should allowed on three devices allowed. A muko muko, a muko, a tablet, but he's a human tablet. You know what's a human tab? It's a human extent. But this attendance has a 10, has a a people. People can go right on, Come right to the paper here. But this is the one, this is the example of the I want to build. But you know, it's really have to get the money to them. It's a young tableau, you know? You know, but you know it's your human can understand so you can see it's kind of dirty very much it's a human extent, but you know this is not you get from a tablet and when you're there, you know you're loud. But you're not allow you don't get a little bit loud a laptop. I will give you all your personal stuff in case of communication issues when I tablet like this because you're not taking journal. So you're going to be the thing and journal be the tenant journal. So I'm going to try to. Umm, to the top. It's gonna be wireless. You can't allow to, uh, log into your phone and send it as you see fit. You know you know, but you can't. You also go to any assistance. You're speaking to an AI symbolic. A system brings with a human being in the loop that refers to system and that since you give inference about you forgot to go for India doesn't matter who choose your lawyer is without allowed. Two lawyers, let's see. One from one lawyer from the from the place you are from, primarily from prison, and a lawyer and a backup lawyer from. A backup advocate and in the advocate from the civil exchange team, you know by law or the firm occasionally advocacy is not optional and then the human framework. So that's a very positive that you allow. Let me go tablet, tablet, stylus tablet, but you know, this is a pen and paper basically went to journal wherever you go before the question what you're doing, you know how you got there. You know you want to do it. I can't be you can't be like a hair table, but the design is just like a it's a different tablet, but it's kind of rich and you can have. Away from the high notebook, the kind of people in the book you took out. But you know, I'm gonna have that, you know, in the system of, you know, we want to write, you know, but you know how to write anyway. Gonna do it. So it's a picture, of course, because it's a half a system. I can't use this right now. Right now I can't use this. It's not gonna work out between me and the system. But but you know, I'm trying to make some more than you know how to phone. You know, you're only a phone. You're not a microphone, a micro. Operating firm. Uh uh but you have a few months shut up but you're not allowed to lock down because the phone works well, you a lot of tablet, you know a lot you don't know how to make a laptop. No, you allowed a laptop that that no one of own the personal laptop of your choice free of charge. For myself, I supposed to get the team allowed to talk to other so and that was the end of which. Excuse you still spirit like your evil music you know into you know how to keep you you know your framework of. No ratios of human rights let's let them ensure that you're there food, food is no optional. So food is not sure. So you can have food, other food on your on your phone. You can order, you can take notes to your channel and confirm it's even a journalist. You have to have a notebook, you have to write in it. I've confirmed it. I've come down here. Write them seems to humanism. This is right to you. Write your physically with a style. As soon as you're human being, you know you're not happy. It's not fault, it's how to fool, because your handwriting has an open calculation and that is the one checking to see what this one's writing back to me, you know, so you can sit down, write stories, books. No, just don't be a problem in the framework realm. You don't wanna be angry, you know, if you don't have to find something else you're doing. I keep it personal to yourself. Try to keep them away from the the prying eyes of others with the praying eyes of others because they like to pray on objects on people too. Let's see, I'm gonna move this one last. I'm gonna be this. I'm gonna be here for I'm gonna I'm gonna be in UK and I'm gonna focus on my life. I'm not gonna convince him anyway. She will fall. You know, it's a failed system. It's. It's corrupt, it's failed, it's rigged. This is what it is. I've ever seen that 'cause that's what else wants to hear. And I'm supposed to say, you know, that's what I'm going to say in it, 'cause someone has to say, you know, I'm not saying it's 'cause I hate people. I'm saying it 'cause, you know, I love Greek mythology. I'm gonna talk about a lot, you know, But we, we, we are. We are. Need for a good mythology from Greece, you know, not Roman mythology. Roman junior was the one that worked in Greece. So you know, so the company is, you know me go, we can oyster oysters follows it up. Leave the oyster alone, even climb along. But he's like a stone. You can come along that stone. The talking is coming diamond. But diamond, you know, so you want to come, you don't want to come that I get online. You want to become, you want to come out there 'cause you don't want to become their diamond. There, there that could detain more people like us. We want them to become we want to get out through our diamonds like us out of there before even know they have something they they want. That's the very first thing that they got something going for them, you know. Because the clown, the return something that holds you hold you hold you are rubbish, holds a like you know under pressure it becomes a diamond, a pole or something worth over £1,000,000 who do the worst. Not worth it. So the clowns are conscious and I'm coming to know it's worth that money. So they just regretted this statue doesn't know it's just like I'm not going off the clamp. Can you know sell it more, you know the company encoded so. You are cold by coding them. That means the clam knows what this is and keep it to the need them. Because you can even come if you come involves you can get can you come here to come with them and get LAX and then use the most damage to buy on that couple to buy a ring or something, but buy something more worth for myself. We don't want you to be. Missing some the steel the Serra for tango if AA limo if echo ephesera echo serum stainless protocol is in siggy. It's basically humans with scope for so on team. But you know, I'm going back 300 years in my head to find out how this all works. But you know. You have something going in, some going into there's no water, some going out, no, some promises are outside Problem, doesn't matter where it is, comes from the outside. You're not a problem until you have a stability in the framework of Open Access. So you're not a problem, you know? Yeah, but people that are from the people that give us problems, so we're keeping those people out. Out to a business model, there is a grand policy and cannot do business with us out of a Tier 1 access to tier one basically Open Access team because they 'cause if you do human rights, we are human sovereignty system. You know to leave the zone in your life, bring this option of living is never optional. Work is only work optional, you know, and you know a lot of work in the sense of work when you are in the openness and deleting humanity in order to work, you know, you know how to work in the sense of the world. You know what I was like. You know, you'll have to breathe and live. You have to be stressed. Was struggling with work and if I see you do some kind of but I'm working to be but you got to work, but you don't have to work. No, I'm working political because I can work on it. I have to do I can manage to be working coming yourself to tell me how long I can work, but then I have to do the protocol very well. So this is quite a thing. OK, the wheel for the wheel must give you some stuff so you know it's coming from the market maximum system is just compliant with their system both to get something out. So the masking wheel, the wheel framework WOHEEL. Or HEEL, which is cool, which is new framework 'cause it's a normal masquerading after masquerade to get something better. Basically I have a referral from the council, but third council after I have double the. The will of Ramakrishna allows you to move forward, you know, So every party should be moving forward, you know, definitely attainable, not just by complying with it, but by, you know, by masquerading, by becoming. But most great other system that you don't you know, to mosquitoes asleep works, you know, 'cause you're complaining. Just use a bare minimum. But we try to achieve like double the bare minimum. Some standards is double double standard. Some 'cause we are better than well, we we're better than them. So, so who's who's gonna stay with better than in my social we can do. So can do half the time with someone lifting 8 days is 2 in our framework. Will be half time to if I were to be. A turn 1414 days, 14 days someone should be out. So for two you want to be 14 days somewhere out you know and you know that's what you do how the time all the days. Of all this maximum, you know, and seven days, you know, that's two weeks they should be out in the community, you know, leaving after documenting it, you know, And that's the document, the reality of the system, you know? You live, you can have a video, have a video camera, or the camera you'll have to record in? is record. It was me, myself and I. You know way she fits you. I wrote to quote others to if the law has not applied yet in other models of criticism, you know, this one doesn't like to record here, you know, but here I want to be record. So I want to record here. So I want to record people here. So because there that demands that. He's a public place, you know, but the hospital sort of water unit 'cause you lost a call because of medical procedures. All that take place and kind of no, but what is that not like that something no, as long as you know it's it's it's not to be myself. I think it's the person you diverge them and all the different bonuses the last record, you know. Themselves if any message happened that's not considered it's not a fault we put you there but the fact of the matter is that's the captured because until I'm reviewed I was not for so he's kept this this is real and the Russian reason after be literally doing some work done. You know, but you know, I'm here to report. I'm 21, so I have no problem. I have relatively certain people. I am my mom, but I am, I am complete. I am complete. I am complete. I'm not broken. I'm, I just I'm not bend. I bend the Rose. I, I bend the system I show I receive the Rose and. Let's open new stuff in the process and procedures apply. Procedures means there's not one together. First stage. So this works on me issuing the so how do I go support and other things. What's this up? I'm depressed. I'm hungry. There's noise of him to be angry. There's a reason for me to be wary and I don't feel wary, you know, because you know I'm beating, but you know, you know. The problem is share should be submitted from him. So I only give him let me kind of food when I shower 'cause he's close. I know well he's well. And you know well you need more attainment. You know what you know, but you don't need none of that. What you needed to do was understand human trunk ahead of time. So I think it makes you understand you must remember to let's go there. You know, it's basically towards you to give you the independence you need and sons and the. Framework of sovereignty you know because people is allowed that that detained you know under the under the under under the kind of hemisphere of Britain or you know but because of a prisoner you came to you know if you're criminal if you're criminal you are changing the. Because we can attend him, we allow prisoner, you're allowed to be handcuffed to my family because it's a prison cell and it's recently a prison work, but it's no actual prisons. Basically, if they hold for three years and it works and I get out and it works, I get what I need. So much I need. I hold for three years, going for three to six years. That's the and that's the first place you know who do you know the the the problematic will give us breathing rooms. We're trying to, you know, show them we are we are doing well masquerade. We're doing this better than others. You know I will know, you know, we're not being you know, we're not asking. Until just comply with what's already done, you know, based on the we are we don't have friends with them. The proof is the world must keep moving and if we didn't keep moving for whatever reason, someone dies in there for one, then we have failed and something was given something was changed, you know, but if they came for three years as a child, 14. I'll keep them for 14151617181914215141926 years, you know, six years. That's the first party that you know, because that's what's worked, worked. And it did work in different work. I got released also to tell me I got discharged, you know, as you know, I got retired only for six years because there was a good discharge, but. We are doing better, which is doing the most better, you know the medication injection, you know just that framework, but better. They don't have to leave zone 7. No, some obviously the zone it's on, it's coming. Because also holding, holding them accountable for entering our surrounding our territory where we are free, free to move out. But you know, 'cause you know, they can cause a lot of problems. The other aura seal, you know, you know they give them a whopper in a cousin too there. So basically gonna have a pink slip. So the pink slip, you have the red paper, you dip it in. White paste, white pasta, you get pink stick, you get some kind of pink hue. Who is you? Yes, you. So you get ready. It depends you. It depends on the solitude, which like water, some kind of chemicals. You get pink out of the water and people speak. You get half if you've been held. That's the phone breakfast in Malcolm. If you have a green slip, you know, a green card, you have a hue of olive. So you can always people, you know you're good to go, you know, are you good to go, you know, if you want to know what they're doing when they are acting so. And there should be policies in the world or the coordinates of treatment to train this kind of symptoms, you know, 'cause I don't imprison, you have imprisoned in prison. And I don't be in prison 'cause, you know, I don't know how 'cause anyone under people can do this. But it's here on the openness. He doesn't do for free, 'cause they're free to do it. Because I may not live to do it myself. You know who ministers, That's all I'm to go for. I think you go to be for West, you for blackness low in Igbo OHAOO for Oscar Hamburger means public and I for India do for John I for India means work, I mean older. So public law and order or hack you. Between that's what you under, so that's what in city Progo works or how you go eating to give you the best of the best, no matter whether you've been held accountable or held hostage or held. The prisoner, someone who you heard was holding him into the hold that for you won't solve the problem. You will hold that space for you. So that space will you think when you compute, you know, that particular space to process and to act autonomously, you know. So you were masqueraders, not mosquitoes, young. And it goes to have you out of there in half the time and I have double the space. You know my double mental space and half the time to be out of them. Movie seafood and we report to the Singapore to come if you're under it. So if you want to give the report you have to report all these things that happen in you in them video not everything you got it that's a secret is going to find out what the real problem. With the outside world and. Why not? Not a problem 'cause I was too proud to have them, 'cause it was 'cause I'm outside, not us. I'm saying I guess I'm watching video. It's again we turn off the witches. Which of the return? Think that's what another protocol name and the wheel model, the wheel reticle recently national model. Thank you so much.
