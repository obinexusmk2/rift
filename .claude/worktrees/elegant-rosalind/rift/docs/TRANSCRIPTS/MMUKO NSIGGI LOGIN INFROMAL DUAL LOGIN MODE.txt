Anyway, um so basically Nambdi uh so today's date um is the time is now uh 10
0:08
9 uh 11 no the date is um 11:17 uh uh p.m. in the owners. So um the time
0:15
now is what uh 23rd of uh uh December 205. Um so no policies here yet but I've
0:23
got this recorded limited files anything I have to hold in this space and time.
0:29
So you want to always hold space uh first double time uh you know depend you know if if you come from space you are
0:37
if there's space for you if you have time if you have the time what you have double the space um because you know uh
0:43
double the space equals half the time so two space you have to have half the space to create a time so that kind of
0:49
thing two half spaces so uh like you know if you have um half of pi pi r² uh
0:55
you have um what you have if you have the area p r² that's you uh in the linear sense 2 pi r uh 2 pi r
1:03
which is r which is your your 10% uh 0.5 um uh to the^ of 3 uh uh which is 0.5 um
1:11
uh* 0.5 which is one uh 1 * 0.5 um 1 *
1:17
0.5 um which is like 1 and 1/2 so you get one and a half which is like the
1:23
trident philosophy of stability um but this video really focuses on project and for mic and for my youth umbrella for
1:30
Oscar K for kilo coffee. So I'm trying to um create some kind of steel room for myself uh because for my I'm trying to
1:36
create quantum computer but you know this is my quantum interface. Uh what do I mean by that? So basically
1:41
uh mucos signal is my social media but I'm trying to literally be in the physical space the physical space I
1:47
already have in my room but kind of sucks um because it's not like a mad
1:52
crocis. Um but I'm not mad it's just my philosophy. So, I'm not going to do any
1:58
math today. Um, but I do know what I'm going to do. So, I'm trying to hold the G space forever, but you know, in the
2:04
physical sense. Uh, so what that means, so I'm going to have my own still room, but I'm going to have my digital store room. So, the room is going to be um
2:11
double the know I get 15 um square acres. So, 15id by 3 uh divided by
2:16
fourid by three um that's ratio 15id by 3 is four and you know in time time and
2:23
15 divid by four is three. This is not good enough. So the time uh so if I have
2:29
the time the for example if I have four um 4 m squared uh uh 4 m* 4 get 4 me 4
2:36
we need three of it we have to show for the time uh um that is the space in the error so 4 * 4 * 4 we have to flip it
2:42
that would be 4 * 4 this is good enough so 4 * 4 * 4 will be um uh 16 16 now 64
2:49
is what 64 the four space that's the xyz co uh but this time so this is the four
2:57
uh cuz you know if I divide by 4 by 3 is four so let me calculate actually um 4
3:02
cub so 4 cub 4^ 3 uh so 4 3 is 54 now we four because
3:12
you know get one more oneative one negative space we all share so the
3:17
negative one is space all share that's kind of model uh so if you have um four
3:23
divided so get for 12 like you know 15 divided by three.
3:31
15 divided by three. Um that's 15 divided by four is three. Three is four. Uh so 15 divided by um three is what? Uh
3:39
uh uh 15 / 4 is three. Three and a half.
3:44
Oh sorry three and a half. So 3id 3 is three and a half. So you have some kind of space uh some kind of fraction share
3:50
and that's 75. So that means you can get um 75 * 4 that will be let's see I'm
3:57
trying to play with this we can we can do trial and error play with this numbers um but you know I don't really like playing with the numbers so I'm
4:02
just like I'm just going to show you you can do a play with numbers and do it uh but I'm trying to give you the informal
4:07
one for your framework now um cuz I'm you doing it because you know you can pause the video so we get um we so we
4:14
share a trident um a full trident of one so we share a fraction of um fraction of like a fraction unit in the space and
4:21
time uh like you know so we never pop of one negative so so just this like your breathing room uh this negative space is
4:27
very important to keep have hold so you hold this negative space at all times you know your physical form uh uh
4:33
anywhere you go in the room you know you don't have to touch your computer you don't touch anything so if you hold some of the space you l just I have this
4:39
space forever in your physical for this room I'm trying to make for myself this is my own still room cuz I need this
4:44
space for my uh um like you know going to the places um where I want to go like um trying to put myself I don't care by
4:51
anyone. So I'm trying to see um the what they're doing in the medium but should be the hold the physical space in the phys form. So this form I hold is above
4:58
price. So I hold 75% 3/4 of the space at
5:03
all times um you know in a bas so this whole quarters is so get three quarters
5:08
of the space um for space and the time uh for the space and time the physical space and the mental space you know
5:14
literally for the computer to hold it. Um so that would be uh 3 + 3 3/2 + 3/2 is what? Um 3 + 3 is what? Um 3 + 3 is
5:22
6. 6 over 9. That's one uh one and one quarter. Um in the physical and in the
5:28
meal that's the same thing. One and one quarter. Uh but you know that be preserved. Um I don't I don't want I
5:33
never want the space. I never need I never need this space. It just has to be there. You know it's a negative space.
5:39
It has to be that space has to be there. I never need it. Yes. I never need it. So he has to be there. So you kind of
5:45
see what I'm trying to compute for you. So now this I'm saying this kind of paper is very important to like you know
5:50
um digitize because space negative one space uh but that's one squared. So the
5:56
errors look so basically it's imaginary numbers you're trying to compute uh you try to keep um you defin if you comput
6:03
them that means you're operating on them um you don't want to operate on negative spaces you want to keep um the imaginary
6:08
numbers in your space you don't even you know even look at it can be um can be annoying. You have to only perform uh so
6:15
you don't only so you should never perform classical on them. You are you are you're in a quantum bra cuz if if
6:23
you can if you get if you have oneative one that's um negative 1 to 1 is um uh
6:29
uh you get a third one uh one square of
6:34
1 is what um uh u um um one I and this
6:40
get square of get square I get I um uh uh I um on it own is an number so this
6:47
is get I squ I * I which is negative one. So you want to keep the area negative one which is a space which
6:54
is a search. You want to keep every unit um there you know even you didn't want to operate on one unit you know cuz you know that can blow up when you have a
7:00
read um of that uh uh you know interpretation it doesn't matter where you are in the physical form uh you have
7:06
to keep that space um there at all times like you know uh the unit model everything uh so what's next is the comp
7:14
so you get um -1 * 1 that will be um uh uh uh I um I * I
7:22
will be 1. Now that's my negative space my four negative. So anything that can for anything has to be a half to your
7:28
house get a half. What would that be? Negative half think. So you get I * I but I * I / 2 is what?
7:38
Uh I divided by two. But what would this be? Uh this be um I
7:46
because this is I. So I * I is what? * I= I uh but you know that's
7:54
I will be half of I so I divided by two will be um what I need to divide so that be just one I uh so one so that be I
8:02
divided by uh uh uh negative I you know so this space negative time uh I have to
8:08
keep for the space so I I keep this unit there so this kind of signal I keep so
8:13
this is the measure number I keep so I is a so e is what is dity e is the
8:18
growth function of i pi so if e if Pi is a imaginary number
8:24
for you. You have to hold that in the mental and physical. So I is what? Um imaginary number. Pi is a number. E is a
8:32
oil is identity. So is basically got to E I P. So I'm trying to show that you
8:37
know I always have this space that's identity to the matrix. So I if I don't if I [ __ ] it up I I have to comput it
8:44
now cuz you know um oiler's identity uh e to power of pi i pi i.
8:54
So basically this is uh plus one= z. So uh I'm trying to keep this um so e to
8:59
the^ of i. So basically I'm going to calculate here should give me e.
9:06
So e is what? 2.71828. Uh but I'm trying to keep this to what
9:11
uh uh the growth. So this be two. So uh so in my in my framework this is two. Uh
9:16
so you get to number two. Two is the the kind of system here because of 71 uh so
9:22
we can use a fractional model to compute it. But you know uh 71 82 um 18 but you
9:28
know uh 2 * 2 4 * 2 is 8 8 * 2 is 16. So
9:33
we try to hold um the space of uh of um a trident bite uh which is um a to the^
9:39
of 3 uh uh times you get 8 I I so you hold I uh which is um I * I which is
9:47
equal to 1 uh uh a negative number uh a negative number um a negative space um
9:52
that's 8 by 8 to the^ 3 so 8 to the^ 3 is um 8 * 8 * 8 so the space you hold is
9:59
trles you get a space you need space you don't need a space you don't want to need want but you know you get um you
10:05
get 27 all you need um for you to be happy for you to be comfortable so you get 8 to the^ of 27 because you know 9
10:12
so if you get 8 to the^ of 3 uh 3 * 3 is what 9 * 3 is 27 uh so 7 space negative
10:18
space so e the^2 so if e is - 27 e^ative 27 is what uh we're going to need um uh
10:26
as a foundation of your um no no need you don't need it it's there you don't
10:31
need you don't want it, you don't want it. You don't even want it. You don't want it and you don't need to touch it. So if you don't need it, you don't want
10:37
it. If you don't want it, you you you never need it. You never you never want to touch it. So that's what you need. So e to the power of 12 is always identity.
10:45
Um uh but it's always number of growth of stable because you know um so basically if you have half of something
10:52
uh growing, if you have something that's growing that that is growing twice. That's where the you know if you have
10:58
like if you put 50% for a month um for a month you get the kind of this kind of
11:03
thing grow. So if you put 50p in a bank for 10% um 10% of 50p say you have5%
11:11
of 10% of£5 is 50p and you put that every um every month uh every month because you know one month is what you
11:18
work you will only work for one month uh uh listen
11:23
properly you know let me do it properly um hello
11:28
I love you uh basically I'm trying to do this properly uh so I got no pen to do it let use my calculator. I haven't even
11:34
got my notes to go cuz I don't want to do it here. Okay. So, let me do it now. So, let me prop so I * I. So, one.
11:48
So, get this room here. So, you get the space I hold here in the physical and the metical. So, I have to hold this
11:54
space. But I don't need to interact with this. You know, you know, if I touch this, but you know, I'm messy. So you
12:00
know I even want to make this and then try to okay this kind of thing I've done so far this my question model don't
12:07
forget to talk about this right now uh but you know you got to do it because you do it yourself and you got doing it
12:12
and that's what it matters to you uh should about it now yes it's very important you talk about it because you
12:17
know it's kind of annoying if you don't uh okay so everything is uh everything
12:24
has a the micros model everything uh has what on uh uh eight sides as an oxyon Um
12:30
because everyone everyone everyone that's not on the conscious place has seven sides basically on my not my level
12:36
has seven sides. So basically they have seven times seven. So basically they have seven parts uh that form their consciousness. So there's um there's a
12:43
simple point of entry you know at the corners but you know um you know because they can expand the
12:50
horizons but to expand your horses you have to you have this corners but this corner your conscious a circle basically
12:56
but it's um it's a octagon because my octagon but I'm see because I I'm
13:02
transcending because I'm you know I don't want to give but I'm kind of idea there um so you got the
13:09
space you have uh but you know I have I I I remember everything in the past. It's m ocean. So I really hold a lot of
13:15
spaces in my head to think people don't really think that. So I'm not really going to show anyone what I do. But but
13:21
you know this kind of so this so the kind of what I'm saying of conscious you got like um uh you know I
13:28
know we I know something just myself I know something uh I know nothing. Uh but
13:34
you know that nothing is cuz I'm not telling you anything and that's epsilon place. So you see epsilon I know nothing. You think I talk to you I don't
13:40
talk with you. You don't know me. You don't see just see your face. Uh but that face is um nothing. Um nothing. So
13:45
nothing but you know that's me fully conscious. Not telling anything. Uh looking at you funny. Um you know but you know we don't joke. We don't just uh
13:52
idol. Um but you know it's an idol state of aut. So we we do nothing. We do that. You know I'm here now. But if we are
13:59
union if we together I hold this place of awareness uh full awareness. But but
14:04
you don't know that you know it doesn't matter what you do you can't see that you know. Um and then you get what uh a
14:10
union district and you get what toography. So basically um you know the
14:15
kind of thing I'm envisioning is this area this pentagon octagon is like eight sides uh that's eight spaces. So you
14:21
need eight input um so it's kind of annoying. So this why it has to be um sparse. So any eight inputs any eight
14:27
data is like you know they share some state some state that's epsilon and
14:32
epsilon is a different state of nothingness that you don't have to touch and that's why it's very important to get that in your head because you know you don't have to see that state even
14:38
yourself now but people can't even comprehend it um because you know it's not in the frame of mind it's not it's
14:43
not in the day of life you don't want to think about themselves so you do so there's like eight octagons but I don't think it's one two three four five I try
14:50
my best anyway because I don't really want to care and you get um you get the first octagon get um they say you can
14:55
switch you can you can for me you know your consciousness already um you know you switch consciousness I'm not even
15:01
reading anything but people can't do this um you know you can you can jump from go from the being conscious to
15:06
being unconscious you know literally they can't do that because you can do that you know just close your eyes just I'm unconscious remember the state of
15:12
unconscious you to be unconscious so that's a problem you are really formalism yeah because you're trying to
15:20
get your computer to probe itself uh for solutions two active problems kind problems uh because you're going to be
15:26
in that space, you know, but try to hack the computer. So, it's it's it doesn't matter where you are physically, you
15:32
want to be there on time for the meme. So, if someone pros your computer, they got a relay system because it doesn't
15:38
matter how far you are, you going to be in this space at that time. So, you trying to find dimension on so if you
15:44
have um if you have a cube a to the^ 3, you share a value a^ 3 length* weight time height and that will be your
15:51
topology, your top tomography. um to go about the inside of so if I send a wave
15:56
if a wave propagates here uh the wave can pop one of my axis one of my things
16:02
uh but you know you know I would know because if this pops in the physical and I'm in a physical that means something
16:07
is but you know my is damaging and that's why I don't want uh so I'm going to die
16:13
in that space I am that's why my student is important it doesn't matter who you are we all share four states because
16:19
four states is is a kind of stability uh for everyone Um uh normally and you know
16:25
you know uh um so you have um eight bits. So you have seven. So you maintain a space of one uh 7 + 7 + 7 which is
16:31
like um uh 7 + 7 plus um 8 plus 8. For every seven hexagon you have a trident
16:37
uh trident to the uh trying topology to the eight only topology matters only only tomography matters you know the
16:43
area you all share um because you know the area is the same uh throughout. So that's the unit. So you get um uh
16:49
nothing and uh something you just have to get something to get nothing. So guys problem there. So it's kind of like a
16:55
problem. Uh so basically I'm trying to answer some kind of philos ontological questions about myself but I know the
17:00
skill because I know people need ontology to this because about you have to you know space only only you need to
17:07
govern yourself and that's why you are forcification can do anyhow doesn't matter how you do if if prove so if let
17:15
me give you example now because you know we're going to [ __ ] it upation so we get um three we're going to try
17:21
we're going we quadruple we get forcing uh but you I can switch between any two state any three states um any two states
17:28
at a time because you know I have two pointers so but you know the two points are very important so what is the point
17:33
of problem why does the problem matter so if I'm actively switching consciousness on states um I'm switching
17:39
personas I'm switching abilities and who I am what would that mean so so say you have your line you have a line sequence
17:46
instructions um so um so for one time for one time you hold eight um eight bytes eight eight bits eight bits uh
17:55
every instruction um linearly uh an array. So you can process them only print them as a row. Uh if you row you
18:01
can put them as a column can be if as a row
18:06
as a row but you know you want to have the maximum one to start with because that's the you have the minimum size. The minimum one will be eight bits.
18:13
Eight bits. Eight. 8 bits. Um 8 bits equals one by one by so eight bits. Um 8
18:18
square will be um that'll be 8 square. That'll be um 16 16 uh by um 16 by uh
18:24
per one instruction at a time, you know. But you should flip this. So you say I
18:30
can start here, but because I can start here, uh I can start here. I already know I can start here. So I start, you
18:38
know, I want to start with the phone. I'm just going to make sure I do it properly. Oh no, no, no. Uh, basically
18:45
I'm trying to mitigate relay attacks um to my consciousness. No. So basically whenever I try to log in I I didn't want
18:50
to my computer guys. So basically I'm seeing this full state
18:56
of consciousness no topological that's what I should be concerned about. Nothing more nothing less. Um uh uh so
19:05
what do I do now? So, so get four tomographic states and that's basically
19:10
um 8 * 8 cuz you know I know I'm going to be so get eight um eight eight but you know but the area is um eight um the
19:17
area is only eight so you get the edges you get a signal so it doesn't matter what is the real signal you know you
19:23
have to understand actively um fix yourself um so you get um eight um eight bytes eight bytes 8 * 8 * 8 you know so
19:31
you always want to be in a live state um b if you're alive you're dead you know so you want So what you want to know the stage you are live you're going to be
19:38
best in some you get 8 by 8 * 8 cube that's 8 cub that's a cube um sorry guys
19:44
I'm trying to do the math now cuz I have to do this properly I'm trying to power three uh so you want to know for 52
19:51
bytes of memory you need cuz that's 8 byt um 8 bytes of memory if you get 52 by now get um in space and time in space
19:58
and time in space and time at a time so at one time you will need of at one time you
20:06
need one space or that is allocated from 12 by five. So basically you have some kind of polarity you're going to define
20:12
via the pointers. Uh, for example, if you hold two spaces, you're really allowed to run uh run on two spaces. You
20:20
get 500 two spaces, that would be 512 plus 512. That will be what? Um 4 uh uh
20:27
basically at the minimum will be 512. That's what we do. Uh two two + 2 is 4 2
20:33
and 10. That's you go to 124 bytes of memory uh that you can at the minimum
20:38
you can we all share at the union and so we all share that at the minimum d rate and intersection um we all share we
20:45
don't we don't we don't really get what to share uh you know and we get 512 by um 512 by um 512 * 52 that would be
20:57
that'll be 512 * 2 512* 512 and that would be 26 64 uh 144
21:06
by two 2 thou 2,262 uh 262,44
21:12
bytes of memory. Um we share we can share because local maximum uh this one
21:18
I have that you can never know you you must never know you you know but there's two things you can do for every two
21:24
things you have. So that kind of idea uh there you know every two inputs have two output uh uh you know because you have
21:29
two operation you can perform at one time uh because you know but the time I see is on the time you share so defined
21:36
there so you get um 54 by so tomographically this will mean the the area of um area two space you share at
21:44
one time I'll need um uh the area to be 512.
21:53
So basically uh any space I take 226 bytes should only allow me to have um uh
22:00
if this is login this is login this is login the time has to be of one for me
22:05
to keep that space so because you know the space is always there aline
22:11
so I always have some of them so so I have to get the time uh the time equivalent in space time so so the time
22:18
will be um the time uses of at time so that will be a login time
22:23
login time that will be equal to 101 time or I can get 1 / 1 / log n time uh because if you
22:33
get if you get time first you get login time login time but you know if you get the time divided that be log n time
22:41
divid by lo time and that be 01 time so my login time will be 01 locally and that's what should be allowing uh first
22:48
or locally first or locally first prioritizing I should be I should be prior because my one should be
22:53
prioritized and then if I get a log login this place you hold but you can interact with me uh is annoy so you have
23:00
to that's why it's form toographic you know I hold this kind of space but it's mosaic maic so I know this place but I
23:07
can see so I'm going to uh this is this what I'm saying so it doesn't really
23:12
matter what you do it preserve itself at one point at one time you know it
23:19
doesn't matter so uh the problem is that the bically I'm I'm pro I'm operating demographically uh because it's bound
23:25
that area. So uh the goal I'm trying to do is listen if I walk in to my store room and I don't want to log in the
23:31
computer registers that listen I just think I because if I walk anywhere my I don't I don't want to be to log into
23:37
something that can literally I I don't want to press start you know maybe I mean like I'm arriving
23:43
outside I go to my store I get security but you know security doesn't mean security inside so I come from access inside to
23:49
day I don't even need the food and that's kind of the thing I I'm trying to put because the food doesn't need to be there used to be like cinema room. So
23:56
it's like you can go to four dimension for the so because there's no lock involved you just have to measure the
24:02
waves of the for series on the transform if you lap the left rotation lapers cuz you if you parameterize the left two
24:08
left if you have two left hands or two left leg what you can walk can you can walk it still walk it doesn't matter how
24:15
you operate you know because the idea is that two left two two left operations two left two anticlockwise so 180us
24:22
negative 180 negative positive can also learn the the right uh role, you know,
24:27
and you can still do all the right operations. Um that's kind that's why you see negative spaces, negative everything. That's what the lapis model.
24:33
I'm not going to do it today cuz I'm going to try to uh do but really know what I'm saying because you have to have
24:40
if you have two left copies. Uh so let me give example. Say you have a a copy some of copy a copy and attach.
24:49
So uh copy and attach. So yes. So if you copy if you copy an artifact copy a file
24:54
uh in the right one okay okay in two if you have two left copies what you are you're reading it uh twice or you see
25:02
you're reading so if you have two left copies operation CP in a terminal two left copies what you got to do is read
25:08
it twice read it twice uh uh so you read two read two read or you name two R but
25:14
you know two this is why so if you have two rift two read two reads you uh your
25:20
run implicit right uh because you know that's basically the buffer stored to
25:26
some kind of temporary storage but that temperature has not been uh created uh
25:31
fully created so it's bally trying to create a space it doesn't need yet so that's what it means so if I'm
25:37
polarizing left I'm looking at myself and stuff because I'm like a so if I'm facing right I'm looking I'm trying to
25:42
look at someone else but if I'm facing myself I'm looking left so I'm looking at myself but I'm looking at myself
25:48
right now so in the future or in the past in the future want you to do something. So
25:53
basically doing something actually trying to do something but I'm creating
26:03
model now before you [ __ ] it up. Uh read uh read or write um read or read right
26:08
or read uh sq. Uh so you got to read write um right. So you only read right and that's a nail. So read right nail.
26:16
So if I read uh if I read something I am writing it. So I have one read for one read of submitting. This is very
26:22
important. Don't forget this train uh this selfing trade. So it's an so if I
26:28
have one read of a file I'm writing it but I'm doing something operation but
26:33
you know I'm not creating so it's read. So it's because
26:40
so okay let me do this again. So you have like so do it again. uh read,
26:45
write, execute. So read, write, execute like a create uh uh destroy uh sorry has
26:52
a rebuild, re build or break if it breaks. And if you want uh what you want
26:58
you want uh quit, destroy, re uh build, break, and what? Um uh quit, destroy.
27:04
Build or break or what? Repair or renew. So this what you're
27:11
trying to solve. This kind of very important problem. your your because you're because you're because you are really smart and you have to define it
27:17
structurally that so you have to have some kind of a one laboring segment some accolator to you you know dedicated to
27:25
you but knowing you're crazy go here you you never want that to be craziness you know cuz you know you're trying to
27:30
prevent yourself to the community uh but it sounds kind of crazy but this community there so let me do it properly
27:36
genetically this be tomographically layer so this you kind of have the whole area inscribed into your local system,
27:43
but you know all the other but you get your local your local maximum space and you get the space around you uh that's
27:50
outside but you know you get space uh you know basically trying to give get as much noise give as much noise as
27:55
possible but you're controlling the space and time so it doesn't matter you're trying to send signals on in space but you know trying to get space
28:02
to get back to you but you know you don't want their noise to be your signal soever so you want to ensure you have
28:07
full you get no signal you want to give them no signal so no nothing but you know you can propate By mine, I can send
28:15
um if I can send one one one terabyte per unit. Uh basically, if I want to
28:20
claim my TM, the terabyte is what? Um how much is a terabyte?
28:27
How much is a terabyte? Okay. So, this more my computer I meant to do
28:34
uh I have to do it properly. A terabyte is what
28:39
guys I really don't know how much is terabyte terabyte um teraby is
28:46
just give
28:51
so basically uh we got 1,000
28:57
no okay basically I don't like this no more
29:04
does Does anybody own a polar bet? No. Nambdi. Okay. Nambdi. Um yes. So
29:09
basically yes. So the terabyte is state of it. But you know I want to get the user by the we share a terabyte. Anyone
29:16
can get a terabytes because one to the power of four uh the for the because everyone can get it because state of it.
29:22
So one to do is get a TMP a TPM clear uh operation but you don't define the clear
29:27
function. For example uh you got a terabyte per unit per unit clearing model. So the unit is a local space you
29:34
share which is like um your your um your room of 75% 0.5 but you know this um you
29:39
don't you frame everything you observe you can't observe anything you can't get anything from it look wonky it doesn't
29:45
model the data you don't get anything you don't give nothing that's solution you going to get so I'm trying to define this properly the Cisco model uh because
29:53
everyone sh on one half of something and everything you know one half of everything and nothing
30:00
uh uh via the medium Oh, let's remember the space for them. Uh, via radio wings radio. So, rent's money is visible under
30:10
x-ray glasses. Um, rent money is uh uh Ren's money is visible under X-ray
30:17
glasses. Uh, this same so everything is radio wave. Uh, starts off as a radio wave, but I don't really believe this.
30:23
So, you get I believe this because you know you get a radio wave as electric signal or what? um elect wave that's
30:28
wireless or elect wave that's mic free forever radio wave and a microwave um radiography so you get radio waves first
30:35
um it now but we get red shift so anything moving away is a radio wave but if you get enough red shift it's very
30:40
important to understand you know you can gain information so you don't want any noise in the system
30:48
so basically I'm trying to make this properly because you know if it [ __ ] up on me it [ __ ] up everywhere you know
30:53
cuz you know it's going to not work so you want everyone to see red um red never blue never like a red green blue
31:00
never a blue never green or blue uh because that means that you are you are not doing so you want to see them see green they get more noise blue they get
31:07
more noise so what does that mean so you fire function that gives only noise um so if there's a filter if a flash you're
31:16
see you're trying to function clear that clear a terabyte per unit so every space
31:22
is per unit so so basically this function like this you get so if you try to destroy a terabyt a nuclear right you
31:28
everything the disc you're trying to nuke the disc but you can't do this safely so what you got to do is
31:34
literally have a noise start so what this means you know you take your time
31:39
and you know you want to clear everything so when you start create a space you create space memory to clear
31:46
everything but you know that will be um some kind of bas so that be that would be um uh eight bytes eight bytes of me
31:53
but that eight bytes um of memory is not good enough um to do it because that bit is what you need in the distance. So
31:58
eight bytes of memory 8 it's a power of three it's 27 bytes of memory to clear that's what you need um that's unit of
32:05
space you need to start destroying everything like me that's like you saying let's just write in the what the the command what uh the the touch touch
32:13
so the touch command is what you touch something but you can touch something to destroy it so the touch the restore but if I touch
32:20
something I nuke it so because I'm trying to nuke it nuke the whole disc so basically I got my um watch I got my um
32:25
disc there um what I got see Nambdi uh Nambdi, make sure you get it. That kind
32:30
of disc is there. So don't touch it, Nambi. But you know, you got n touch it digitally dig away from you nuke. Uh so
32:38
you can destroy everything that's there. Um that's even how the memory organizes. So you go to just touch that file in
32:44
that system and clear everything. Uh so you can have your own system uh split your system even how the memory
32:50
alignment is. I don't really care that that so that kind of thing. What's it called? with the W this WD um um
32:57
terabyes you try to nuke it uh but you know n safely that's the idea
34:11
blue if you have B square B square that means the area is blue so it's kind of a color system um so uh red green blue um
34:19
it's digital space so uh so basically you're trying to ensure it's all decentralized uh for example if a
34:24
artifact has a problem so demographically uh he has to able to fix itself uh he
34:30
has to send only one signal and you know someone can start getting to fix it get
34:35
you know it should be fixed by when it's done but send another signal it's like you know someone has to fix it now you
34:40
know before it starts to fail um you know everything so uh litize computation
34:45
signal operation so basically you got to define a walk cycle or some kind of speech cycle uh no matter where you go
34:51
you kind of like I'm able to know system knows you are there you hold that space whether in the physical and the mental
34:57
because you know it's a room that you are you are in uh and a bubble doesn't matter eat a burger or something. So, so
35:03
blue blue or blue squared equals one orange. uh two orange if I see two. So if I observe two blues um that means
35:10
that's one orange that means you are in danger you know but you know danger but you know if I observe a blue on myself
35:17
that means I'm in danger uh one blue um one blue so that means that someone's observing one you're blue twice that
35:23
means you see orange that mean you're in danger because it's called encoding um but that blue means you're in danger because that's you uh uh dash you to the
35:30
world it's encoding system for this and you get two blues equals one two two blues or blue squared this means This
35:37
space is um dangerous. This area just one area, one space is dangerous. This space is dangerous. In danger in this
35:42
space uh what? Um two greens. Two greens means what? Two greens or two greens
35:49
means someone I know uh someone I know is in danger. For me, for me for two greens, one green means um um I I think
35:56
someone might be in danger. I know someone might be in danger because I I observe this state already. Um but you
36:02
know uh cuz this guy is showing green. Okay. So So basically Grim is safe. So you have a green area. So if green that
36:09
means safe but you know you can shift between hues. So if I'm green you know that means I'm safe but if I insult you
36:15
what light green so you are like a but I want to change color but you get light green. So b insult you that's like you
36:23
know your system glows green but this red green if you're all green we won't see green we all happy you know but it's
36:29
all green one green lights. Um and then we get um a red red is like a danger. Uh
36:35
red means like is failing. Uh so M we have infinite um precision uh and you
36:41
know everything's going to blow up. Uh basically with the competition everything's failing. So if if I hold if
36:46
I hold a space of two red uh red red is red that means uh I have my pie my pie
36:52
is my area is dangerous and I have to start um fixing everything. Um but you know maybe I'm not a problem but I have
36:58
to start going. So I can if I if I turn on if I then first of I have a switch and I turn it red that means I'm trying
37:04
to do something. I I can know something. I I know I can fix something. If I do if I then do if I then zoom if if I zoom if
37:11
I zoom in once my red squad if I have the red square that means I know my space that means everyone's listening to
37:16
me because I I I'm only me I am the one
37:21
everyone's in my space uh cuz you know everyone's looking at my space uh red square but if I then look at myself I am
37:27
the node in the system or my uh red becomes my node my demographic node that means um I want um to actually do
37:33
something uh this can be good or bad um right or wrong um which is why the probing of the system matters cuz you know I can do right or do wrong but I
37:40
can say I am right so basically everyone must involve the system uh every everyone gets consistent to do it consistent to do it uh so it's kind of
37:48
annoying because you know I'm trying to define properly uh via the doesn't matter how you walk how you talk the TP
37:54
you clear you you b if you if you have if if you have the if you clear if you clear a power if you clear if you have
38:01
if you need if you only need 8 to the^ of three to have some kind of a destroy
38:06
new command which is a CL which which is like a new for example 8^ 3 is 8 * 8 * 8
38:12
which is 16 so if four bytes of memory uh by memory um uh uh four bits of
38:20
memory or 8 cub 8 to the^ of three bits of memory uh uh bytes of memory that will be the same memory I need in xyz
38:28
dimension uh and that's kind of the kind of thing minimum I need that's why it's based on my reference but because I
38:33
don't incl have an SSP to declare it uh as a policy lock that down you know you
38:39
lock it down because you reserve it forever you don't lock it down you should call as a policy so that's kind of it doesn't matter where you have a
38:46
row color right row or column conjugate it just has to be there for that you only you that's part of three and that's
38:53
like a bes of memory you need at all times and that that bite is like the only so if you touch something you're
38:59
literally just trying to either touch it what to to destroy it uh destroy it or nucleate when you destroy it twice
39:05
That's you can either what right to it right to you don't want to ever write to something you just want to observe something be destroyed like just
39:11
touching touching touching something touches that you touch something if a
39:16
file touch like a folder um um um
39:22
slum clear so let's look um
39:28
okay let's okay let's look so if you have a folder this key uh do slash um Uh
39:34
dot keep so you get different so keep folder this
39:41
keep folder keeps everything okay okay let's this keep this doc is a folder you want to keep do keep but in this doc you
39:47
have two folders found uh and what lost so you should destroy everything in this
39:52
reg is very there so keep uh keep is your
39:57
you keep everything uh farm is you find everything everything is in the file mean you find everything you don't know
40:03
um you This thing you find everything found is there and you know it's found everything that lost is like lost file
40:09
but you keep whatever um you so what would you do? So you just touch this file and destroy but you know you have
40:15
some GPU. So if you have tradition so everything for all the terabytes here so you get to quadruple so it's power four
40:22
um so you get all the memory but you want to touch everything you
40:28
want to touch deck so touch uh uh touch I used to touch uh I used to touch what
40:34
touch keep uh and you run some uh uh command uh relay command so command so
40:40
you have this for do-ep and now keep We want to keep some
40:46
command arbitrary system you want to keep. So we want to catch that. So let's come let's call it death call void. So
40:54
we need to nuke. So this nuke is like destroy everything. Uh but you don't
40:59
have to like it's like your you have some password here. So this power
41:05
interface you have to give some signal you know you don't want able to nuke it for example. So you you want to be there
41:11
to read that because you no one can nuke it because you know you have to touch the file you have to actually touch it
41:16
actually that's kind of idea. So it's like get uh get um raph
41:24
if you go to get you have get um you can if you like touch and you press tab tab
41:30
you can see all the files you don't even to see all the files you see in mic if you see if you if you touch
41:36
keep all the folders you are and you you can't even go to can't even observe all the states because you know if you don't
41:41
know if you don't know what if you don't know what the state of the key keep folder is you don't know what's going to be in there and it's truly hidden to you
41:49
uh because you know you are not the author because you don't own the system uh which I'm trying to make you know
41:54
doesn't matter how much you b the state for you is null because you know uh because you can't you didn't create a
42:00
state you can't enumerate the state uh and that's what matters to me so that's
42:05
you you didn't create the state you did not create a state you will never be able to find the state the program
42:12
folder state uh all the files that there it's possible to even know it's Yeah. Uh
42:18
because you know you cannot get it. So that's the function trying to provide. So um uh let's end the session here
42:24
because G. So uh what's the problem? Problem uh define a to define a
42:29
topographic topographic filter over the set of
42:35
two two right lapis. Two right lapis. Uh two right half
42:40
flappers um to one full left flappers. uh which like um the two left one uh and
42:47
that'll be tr um two left lapis lapis or
42:53
integral lapis uh for the tomographic of phantom uh that keeps that hold
42:59
epsilon a set of epsilon bytes like a a series of a trident series a series of
43:07
epsilon epsilon bytes viatological ref of point of ref point of reference
43:13
via dual dual pointer dual pointer series. Um uh if I hold if I hold two
43:19
spaces if I hold the three spaces I should um the people should only see
43:24
half of the time uh because half of the time will give them no information uh to
43:30
run execute arbitary code on my ecosystem. Um obviously and they'll be touching death touching nothing because
43:37
the file doesn't exist to touch. So there'll be no arbitrary commands you can construct via auxiliary patterns uh
43:44
uh basically things you don't command you can run uh you can define ahead of time uh to get some to execute super
43:52
operation. So that's what we're trying to do here. Yeah. So this your for statement it's very ugly um but that is
43:57
formalized. Uh uh so again you are trying to um ensure that you know
44:03
anything after your speed anything outside your field view uh doesn't have a hard doesn't matter um it's shed by
44:08
radiation uh by the radiation of the noise the noisy system world because uh
44:14
being in the medium in the in an alien world it's like I'm literally being in the people that really smart you know uh
44:20
people are really smart but you know at your level and that's what you're trying to mitigate it sounds crazy but it does work the way it does. So two left
44:26
rotations uh are your one because if you rotate once you're either right or if
44:32
you rotate again you're wrong but you don't know where you're going to be. So you get a probability of 50/50. Um so that's why you have the lapis the left
44:39
rotation of two left rotations as kind of integration states um because you need four right rotations which is um
44:45
four integration to make your full one full. Okay. Thank you guys.
