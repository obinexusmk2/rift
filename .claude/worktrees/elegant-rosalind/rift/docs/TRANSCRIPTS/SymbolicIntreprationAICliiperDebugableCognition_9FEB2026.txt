-------------------
OK, OK. So this is going to be very important. It's basically on today's date is the 9th of January. 29th of February 2026. The time now is. 1:22 AM. But I've got his board here. What are you saying sogithub.com. It's awful. Ontological and forever, Sarah. I for India, G for golf. I for India, I for India. Well basically the human rights protocol, Obi are both ontological Beijing intelligence infrastructure. Oh, oh, after 12:08. So this is OBR first of all. Intelligence Architecture. Architecture refers to the terms how it's built. If you're after draw, you're accused about how things are built or how to what, why, when, when, why? This is the video architecture as infrastructure PSI. Well, architecture says how we build stuff. The architect of a computer, humanized computer like Insignia like. The octave builds how to watch when, when, when, why? Oh well, this is just the architect Guinea. Well, you're proven so also it's built, but you have targets, infrastructure, it's architectural one target 1 demographic. So you got the job as infrastructure. Esri and you got infrastructure as architecture, you know, beautiful demographic of people, like Chinese people, evil people based on target operating systems. But I'm going to do this video because I've been doing it for a long time. But it's very important because of AI. I couldn't sleeping. Yeah, so can I have tea? That was. If i could just say 5 minutes see more of 30 seconds timeout because it's timeout 3015 and. T130T215 and T3. TT 3T sub 3 equals 10. Oh, people, don't turn, turn. So the 10 seconds you have to try to. For five seconds you know O2 equals the time to equal to time or change the time for a second. So you know 30 seconds. I have 5 minutes, there are 5 to 10:15. Terms so 10s of us now something to do a different 1, so 5 * 2 is 10. 3 * 5 is 15 and 30 is 10 * 3. Yeah. So you know, let's start with this model here, you know, but you know, the golden video took about the left hand side. I was pressing on the wrong side, you know I was right inside. So this time is basically the time to introduce the Dai system. But you know, you're getting sickie. Oh yeah, Guinea. So Guinea is a Moscow. Is it so? Guinea is a parrot, you know, GINRG for gold, G for gold, gold I for India, N for November, I for India. But it's part of the project of actually what some Guinea little means what and evil. West Ham AAT W West Ham West Ham AT Guinea G for gold, I for India. But the time is consensual, so you know, it's a consensual AR system for human rights as a protocol. You know, especially an authorological architect behind its own mind and probe itself and so, so forth. Derby 37 six I wish to be. The precinct is 1800. What is 18,000? 1515. It wasn't 515 * 6 is 1 1/10 of 52,000 seconds. 600,000. 100,000 seconds 60,100. There's no system here that works for people, but you know, it's basically a filter flash sequence. So I'm going to go slowly. So we have 4 categories of fish or flash sequence. But you know, you know, business is symbolic. A symbolic Trident resolver get to get yes, no, maybe. So the computer holds on purpose, but that holds is a is a yield. So basically it poses, but it's a four horse thing. It holds obviously using people. Basically it yields something, it doesn't pause it. Mid process or something. So the difference there it's a it's a consensual. It's consensual. You them is if you holding something in memory to resolve. But using is not a whole state. It's not it doesn't terminate the state. For example, if I say yes, if you give a consent, say I'm going on a computer, if I get a cookie, do you want? I say, oh, you say no, yes, I say I never come. And I say, and I don't wait, 'cause I'm not sure. I'm still protesting. I'm protesting a youth state. Well, what yield to the processing is done. You can have a time to. All the programs so we can have yes, which is what's wrong, No Equal to 0 and maybe. Equals to minus Infinity -1 Infinity. Infinity and customs my phone, so Infinity to -1. So really holds indefinitely, but it's true it's over sooner. So yes is A1. This maybe is promised for this. If you can say yes or no to a cookie, I can get maybe which is the target is Infinity. By the system to the power of -1. You're gonna have a constitutional power three, you know, for me. Myself and on and on. This basically means system holds for itself you know me, the system, me getting me kidding so it's getting it's a future system it's hot because. There are three states that resolve and three ways to go. So this is a host. It's an interdependence whole state for a non deterministic factor. You know, it's hard because it needs to hold for the user. It's basically a consensual AI system because the way to the user, you know, until the user could give an input that's. Oh, so he really classified him, you know, a basic consensual concept, consent, consent and consensual consent and consensual consensual. So concession is you need to fulfill need fulfill between Polish the policy you or me, but me 20 feet. I give him, but it's basically. Give me a ***** or to give me pointer and a pointer to your knee. It has to hold your knee, but it's a pointer. So is this your pointer? No. Give you a pointer to mouse print out, you know, get it, get it, get it is a pointer and Guinea is a parrot. So you go to desktop the account first. Who doesn't kidding get a pot no, it's just point for the points now. So kind of Alexa call the system, but this one is based off. So I'm going to start here. Go symbolic statement. The statement is symbolic. So you have the wrap the board. You have you have a simple statement. A simple expression. Symbolic statement it's the rooster that you have for example have something so enable to have diabetic. So there are diaphragm, they are directed, but it's directly symbols of a diagnosis like. AEROU is Tonio. Tonio. It's Tony. You know, A is basically a high tone. Call Autumn. Well, this is basically. The finding symbols of people or philosophy, these symbols that have low tongue. A cold? A cold glyph when they switched. I guess you get 36 letters in the alphabet. To the 5 + 8. You have to assist our government. We don't believe in English. People ask them, but you know, you get there's 4, you get 36. High tone, low tone, a high tone. E i.e. AE I/O There's a word and. If at the high tone a little so these could hide when he has a high accent and then there has no accents and there has no accent means. Teeth, teeth and this means teeth. I can just do your teeth, your teeth. So this just needs teeth. This is what teeth people I say we got as a high, low to high tone Eze the accent. For tea and king are diacratical. So it's a dichotomy over of vows. Vows because they can be told you based on the context of the system, you know, So basically resources. So you can have two ways, 2 interpretations of other based on the target language, yeah. Processes are people you have two english. And the people you know that it was a children language people is not only but you just have accents. So you just have like evil this accents too. But it's a tuna system to fit a flash system, filter and flash system, you know. There's a book of the symbolic system works by having a data, a data drift model, additional drift, a data drift mitigation, data drift mitigation. This is AI, so this is the first idea. Of pizza being basically, you have a lexical analyzer you know. For example, electrical analyzer has. It's right party. Let's put our eyes up because the meat it could indicate sometimes. So you know, you have Alexa, Alexa or let's go analyzer. A house. A house. I don't Cisco, Cisco. How is that? What's Cisco over there? What Cisco Hazel has? What I say was. The symbolic sticks the symbolic. Yes we don't because you can be as a value token invalid token. Or user defined. Use a system system user defined. You did the foreign token. To our systems to know for this tool to meet the other classes you can have. I know, I know this is the process. It's a valid symbol. It's a very simple it's an invalid symbol, it's invalid symbol in the symbol registering so. It's basically have to model like the kind of way natural language operation instables, but it's basically computational language model. Uh, because of consensus needs of business of food, water shut off. So you have a little system of a kind of validity of them, but your delivery was all you can have you define or export or built in, built in, built in symbols like capitalism, this is. This is called a uniform. A uniform. UU Chemical normalization. Uniform like, you know, it's beautiful. They should say Lexa uniform. Conical, you know, should say system. So uniform means they have a tripartite resolution of yes, no and maybe. And chemical means the Sheraton chemicality of domains specific systems. For example the domain of Alexa. Alexa is actually a type of lexical app that identifies words. Also bugs. That looks on tokens to identify 4 categories. So the four categories are the technicalism. But this basically a symbolic statement, a statement that means yes, no or maybe the tripod lose 3 count sticks, yes, no or maybe, yes, no, maybe. Am I right from there System must keep holding space. The yes is a, yes is A1, the no is a maybe and the infinite -1 for the. It's tripartite, so this is different memory. So if it's a time different space queued queue -1 queue for. Spend time a user defined system of space and time so auxiliary constructions of the user. Basically this is a philosophy of ensuring the ending is our system with a -1 whole space. And hold on our space until the user clearly defines that structure. If you're not ghost, you cannot ghost you to know goes to policy services. You cannot go through what you need to clearly define the action you know because you know you get -1. Times -1 So what 1. Please looks like a 512 bytes of data 512 divided over the. of 30 seconds. Electric sensor testing will be. 8 * 8 eight times 5. 8 * 5 eight times 5. You get a 6066 thousand 6000 * 30 seconds. I want to be 1000. 800. Seconds 1800 seconds each 130 seconds. Please take the time ratio. You know space to raise the bachelor, you know get something to say, you get forwarded, you get symptoms. 15 seconds. But the space you have is infinite. You know, you can keep accumulating most pages by typing it in. And you know, the more time you have, you know, do you need more time? Yes, what the time you need. And that time comes an import to the next system. But it's just like. Those of council, of course. So if I say do you want food now? Since I say yes, do you want food later? Yes or no, half here or not? Philosophy of here. I want food now, I want food a hero for you to allocate food. And now I need. I'm here and now. Well. So so I'll come down to I heard that before, but he enough for us to see 4 of partial models of uniform. Beautiful. Counter sense. Carpal cell because the counter sense refer to the idea of heterogeneous, we need to share the heterogeneous homogeneous characteristics. So what I mean by this is they have a here and now of course a noun here, but this year OK, a woman. Is a type of man, is it? No. You have thought in the history you have 4 categories in category theory. I'm defining this formally. So every problem so you have you have a. So you have. 4 categories. You have basically you have 4 digits. You don't see that since I didn't came about by time 1 you have a time 1 error. The other type 2. On top 2, so you did tab 1 so you got a true positive. Force positive. Force negative and true positive. So you get a false positive, true positive force +1 and true negative is a true negative Step 2 classifier. But this is heterogeneous traumatic resources. So basically. Classifiers. So how this work? Is the baseline? Is this reduced resolved? Because of this QA matrix quality assurance. This is the baseline of the heterogeneity of the. But the baseline is literally classifying categories put into categories. Acoustic characteristics that was pointing for the consensus state. So the consensus maybe it's just actually now. So how does work listening you have a true executive location of -1. Wrong here. There's a whole space through Space Force negative, so you hold this space indefinitely. A new logistics. Here, maybe I'm wrong here, maybe I'm wrong here. Maybe type, maybe type 1, maybe type 2. And you know, for example, a woman example statement is a uniform statement. A woman of synthesis. A girl. The girl is top a type of data like a token type of data in the system of woman. Oh man, oh man. You see, So the categories are woman and man. Where does the girl falling? So the categories are this man. So this is the woman. Woman so I'm just identified you get 2 sets of the simple if a woman is literally to get 2 sets of a girl is the type of woman yes or no? Yes. So this is me. So a girl is a type of woman. A girl is a type of girl is a girl is a woman Yes. This is a criticism action. A girl is a type of woman, yes. So this is a true positive yes. So a girl will be here Yeah, a girl. A young woman, A young woman, a young woman. Is no. A girl is a temple. A girl is a kind of woman. Yes, yes, yes, this will be yeah. So this is the client model. So yes. So if you go to the type of 1, the girl is also a kind. So you get you get a tool, you get 4 steps, you get, you get 4 steps, you get a token kind token time. To the to the type for the token value and the token memory, you've got a token client. To concurrent. So the kind of the deal, the kind of heterogeneous model, so this is a type. So you get 2 folks, it's like 14, we just wrote this out and do it again. 1234. So you get a, so you get a certain time. So we get 2 sets of a true false positive forced into. So a girl is a type of woman. So basically there's a type of woman. You know the type of woman will be. 1/4 A girl is a type of woman. There's not a full spot of three negatives from a good little moon. Yeah. So you know, a girl's telephone. So it was the capital of a girl is a type of woman. So the type of woman referred to a true political. Yeah. True provinces. Yeah. So, yeah. So basically, yes, a girl is a kind of woman. Yes. So you get 2 Yes. You have a car, a young girl, a girl is a girl. A girl is a kind of man. A girl is a kind of man because all women, a girl is a type of kind of man, yes. So you get you get the chick 3 positive yes. This true, this is true. This statement is true. It's true, it's valid because the type of woman, the kind of woman, the type of woman, a kind of woman. So it's a young girl, a type of man and a type kind of woman. Because the man that tells man is bar packet, you know, you get a woman for a man. Because a woman, which is a man, but it's a bar Python resolver. So basically it's bar, it's two states, it's bar packets. So this country is true, they can have a different one. Beauty. Beauty. All men, all women, all men are beautiful. Oh, beautiful. Oh, beautiful. Wrong. This one is false because a woman is. I couldn't, I couldn't beauty. But men are handsome, so this will be handsome and beautiful. 2 bar pie tights handsome woman a man so a man is beautiful will be wrong. So this will be a man is beautiful a man so because a man is a type of woman a man is beautiful yes. I'm not as beautiful. Yes, all men are beautiful. You know, all men can be beautiful. Women should be beautiful and women can be so. And mine is beautiful. Will be yes, true, true positive will be here and true positive. So men are beautiful, true positive. All medicines will be here. But these are all sufficiently this is a publicity, all women. So this is exchanges. All women are handsome, OK? Some old women are beautiful. The currently true or false, but normally not, Barlow said. I was just going to the Tom who's going to talk only can consider beautiful. So all men are handsome. All men can be considered handsome because the term handsome is half the shape. You get a half beauty, so you get 1/2. So the term handsome first, you know how you reference them, you know. All men are handsome, you know. But handsome is the man's equivalent of beautiful. So you get a bar practice to gravy stick of mapping, so difficulties and so forth. So woman is beautiful. A woman is beautiful. Aim for a woman is handsome is true. But a man is beautiful is not always true. You know about imagine, I'm sorry, A man is a man is beautiful is false. False. A man is beautiful is false. But a man is handsome. It's true. So men are handsome, not beautiful, you know, so women are a man is a handsome. True, a man is beautiful. No, no, no, unless you identify as a woman. No, unless you unless it won't. So it's a part of lover. It's a bipartisan revolver, the resolve to kind of heterogeneous, homogeneous data of classification or category theory, you know next so, so categories not. Could you use me like you have four kinds of data that physical failure or weekend but you have two sets of that data set at the time and the token type and token value now to give you the Max formula so you have the symbolic statement. Oh no you smooth pressure so this person reverses the kind of idea this so especially this is true or false. So simple. As president, As president's true resource. Three models, 3 pose, tickle pose. They mean something but the pose have a meaning. Anchor, so the kind of system I mean tracking them through. So you have 3 knees. Knees. She have three knees. Knees needs. Needs a lot of. Could, should, could, could. You could do that. You need. You could. You should know. You could. You should. Yeah. Basically it's a point system for news should occur. You should. You should. And could, you could, you could. Well, this is Pharaoh's wants. So you want, you need. We get 3. We get three tickets 3. 3 resolvers basically found 3 resolvers 3 times. We need a should and it could you know 3 expressions. The expressions are because of the positive Alexa, a bipartite Lexa. I get the heterogeneous homogeneous homogeneous causal causal which is further medium of the executive instruction set. Is Alexa a little technology? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Too much. Is that from Thursday? Pass up system C? Yep, a system of a resolution. Consensus. I'm going to write him. So the system must ensure that the needs are met and the needs are literally a completed health talk because you got included for suffering. So, you know, I'm not people understand. Read it, you know. So. OK, one second. Let me the toilet guys. I'll be back. Let me put here. OK. So I'm back now. So you know, so basically you get so, but this is really important. So this has to be not. This is the dynamic system. Let me listen to the ship. So basically I've got this working mathematically too. So yeah, do my notes guys. So you know here is N the submission of R where I suffering. A solution of R = m which you need minus R which is the resources computational resources like space and time and in brackets in brackets times K where the K is a constant coefficient. Of. Of suffering. So, you know, so I'm gonna turn the ball now and give an example of the system here. But we gotta resolve this with the third one, the second time via symbolic intent. So then we go and stop it. Let me just go on here. So I'm gonna clear the ball now. So these are called from categories. But you know, since I have one leader down, so this can be a lesser problem. Heterogeneous Homogeneous Lexapro. Homogeneous vector problem. That's a good problem or a part of problem with problems are shared problems in the domain of identifying the kind of system of change. But mathematically it's sound, it makes sense you can't disprove it. So I'm gonna write the source of happiness, happiness formula. We're gonna work in this very well. Very well. It's gonna happen somewhere here. Am I forgetting anything? So I'm going to put you at some point too, so. So I'm going to have happiness. Happiness is fine as H = F solve. No, no. Astro's cheaper zeal. Love them. Earth was C + V, you know. Of oh. So you know, so happiness is also exploit you. This is a form for happiness, but we can encode suffering. So we're going to compute suffering. So you get happiness as it was set points. Oh, stable step point, step point of the current status. You know your set point of your happiness goal of your. Basically there's a point here and now defining space. For example, for me, your point here and now one person, separate question separate. We have a mapping of happiness of 1. Two cars, 2 cars, 2 cars, also one. So this is a one step .1 full point, but two. It's a DuPont times 118 times to bring 2π to the two Pi 2π / r. 2π / r two times, one is 3. 02 a 2.1 by off to. Uh 2π square 2PI22UH-12. My pencil one is define one set point to the final 2π R, 2π R divided by 180 times. Of two parts divided by R 2π / 1 unit of radius times. Oh, pawn, so 2π. How are Survival 118? Pay off 2π R square 2 pint, 2 pint 2 pints divided by R. Oh, I'm high R square no π / 2 R. 22-R How do you know about two R? Of of party divided by two R Microsoft Pi r ^2 / 1 E. Answers separate. So the separate is formal. You get a circumference, the circumstances. Circumstances that gave you that parts of the circumstances is defined as a current state of being over X ^2 + y ^2 = t ^2. Now t ^2 is a change in. Is wonderful. This was one of sqrt v ^2 + C ^2 for the changing the changes the changing 1 ^2 or T or t ^2 to the change in 1 ^2. 1 divided by the square root of. R ^2 + C ^2. No, I'm sorry. Sqrt v ^2 which is the the vector points or the vector the change in time direction for this Lorentz factor, Lorentz factor. So you get wise one which is. A negative b ± sqrt b ^2 -, 4 root C. This is the question, but X is basically. The actually the first info there's been the marketing system between two-part one of our. One was a crap 127 but as to be a privilege of the range or an area. So the circumference scene is defined as the area. So if the X is an area. So if there actually is an error to see, the circumference will be the tangent line that touches the tangent line. The circles of the B circles of the beam line that touches the second line will be. An area of an area of segment of the of the segment of. This will be high up. Two point R2, point R. But too far if I wanted to two point off. Two point. Also this would be part R-squared. Of our Oscar part divided by part divided by R-squared to R. Divided by three sixteenths. Oscar. But it's the most of the vehicle here no go here so the current supposed to be budget so you get this over here. So the. Spartan Oscar mapping to passport to π Oscars on 360 and you get up the baseline model so voluntary, the voluntary action of the user can use the volunteer. Now the inverter is very important to understand that it is it's a conscious source, you know. This is what you want to try to find the baseline. So if the baseline or something so the contest which are basically based on the coding of the FaceTime. So this baseline would be if R so so yeah, our stated system. System controversial happiness, but we're gonna have to compute in terms of happiness to happen. So to have suffered, so suffer is according to the system. So you can know what suffering is, but it's a simple expression tree. It's important expression tree will give you. 2-3 states Yes no. On the post I like to lose the job. For example you have. The summary question I was if you had to get I was get H get I I is suffering equals to the summation of N need. Need minus resources. Thomas K Charles Ku. Where K is the coefficient of the white term given T&X no. So you know the conditions are taken to amount and recipes in time, you know for the solution which can be. Three X ^2 plus. The three y ^2 + 5 X plus CC times K * K. So how this works mathematically to include suffering is you define. Uh, it's actually umm. So how does it come? If the baseline approaches 0. So basically let me get a simple. SO if the one second imposes only pose is very important. So if the. So no. OK, so I'm going to just now or never? So basically it's not ever. So you're gonna have. A foot so you know, I'm gonna do it now. So you're gonna have something like cope suffering, but it's basically expectation down. So you can have some which is define suffering. Need can be. So the term categories are need and for need. Anthony, don't be for want. Need could could this should? You could, you should. Neither should need his must. Must but need to imply should you know should based on the agency. So this is an agency model in need is a must, but the must could be assured you know because if the user can have agency or can do themselves in other words. Need should want. Should I do it or could I do it? But it is not needed, might be needed or not needed. Listen to especially of a dark so you know. So I'm saying that if resources are more than equal to M. You are suffering it's more than people to em where anything need you know if this is. OK, if if the resources is more than equal to the need, you know, then you are not suffering, you are not suffering. But if they came constant collapse post Israel, this was the baseline, the baseline dropped and you are now suffering. So that's the formula. So the suffering coding is barpetite, you know. So far, you know, so the coolest again is like I'm the piecewise functor they're gonna compete over. So let me sit down now and do the maths. So I'm gonna go with sample problem to do with this now. So my computer here so. Would have suffer problems so several we're gonna come up with is example yeah but the goal is to have future fast equals to cold suffering. We are the actors. I'm going to use it some. The future of Flask sequence is like that. So you have the future flash sequence, but I'm going to do the coding system of the system first. We'll try position, so you're going to have. One second guys, can I have AI equals n -, R * K? Alright, good coefficient. So this coefficient formula here, I'm going to have this encoded into the system, you know, so it was how the states of moderate suffering and basically explicit implicit state of suffering. But you cannot depend implicit state of suffering all the time. So you're going to encode that. So you detect that. So you know, because of the platform target or something like that, it has to be encoded. So that's what I'm saying is pretty software. So you're gonna have I equals suffering. Art is suffering. And is neat and equal is need and is need N equals need. And is neat minus ARM. Always minus ARM owes resources resources. Autumn escape and the power position is like the powers that works in piecewise functions to resolve basically heterogeneous homogeneous data. So the parcel will be if. If N more than equal to MFO. Oh, if resources more than if resources? No, sorry if resources if resources are more than equal to M which is need suffering collapse equals 0 equals to zero and if K implies Infinity if K coefficient. The K is the constraint coefficient, but lacks lacks agency, cohesion or entropy and temperature you have. Infinity. You have this kid closest to Infinity, Some Infinity do you have this You have managed Infinity of volunteering you have. A a sovereign suffering regarding a mindset. You know this is the baseline metric with K classes. Zero. You have a baseline of a baseline, so it's zero. So you like just a frame or if K club is 0. So this is the formula here I'm trying to evaluate, you know. So let me give a problem you have. You have. X = X of Y and ZX and Y equals. Need, should, need, could, should. Exit the FM so Y is so Y is a A3. Let's do the 2Y. Minus -15. As far as X + C + 12 + 12 to get 31 -, 5 X +2. Yeah, so if I plug into the project location you have. Oh, this is my sister. Gonna have to value this now for something. So you're gonna have 3131, so you're gonna get a little one. Are you gonna stop 6 seconds? So I can't do it now. But you got a formula now how to do so. I'll continue, guys.
