8
systems. Okay, before I start this video, you know, I should say some things. So, the protocol say suffering
0:14
is according to suffering is put it into protocol. Uh, let me get a different
0:21
policy. Suffering must be encoded. It must be it is what it is. It must code what should be encoded. you know uh
0:28
basically the goal is to have suffering the future for suffering which I can't find now you know according to promp
0:37
but the goal is to have the business become business code tier two
0:43
um tier two become tier two
0:49
become tier three so it doesn't break you know but I'm working on this for
0:55
myself I'm not looking to do But you know I don't want any favors down you know this program I don't trusty people.
1:01
So uh I'm okay myself a lack of trust uh Audacity. Let me just save this as a
1:08
project uh CD
1:14
encoding encoding encoding. So but you know I just want to tell you what the applications are
1:21
before I stand up and do a lecture on myself.
1:26
Okay. So, so uh let me get some water, some drinks.
1:43
So the goal of this video is to have tier two um which knowledge chair as a
1:52
as a uh as a king chair or uh accent uh
2:00
OB uh but you know tier two is for business
2:06
tier one so open source and open access or github.com/ob
2:12
open for/lic repository on on github.com uh
2:18
to start rebuilding my website you know um but this is the last part of it it's just more part of it because you know
2:23
I'm speaking from you know from the heart of soul to myself not anybody else it's hard to speak to anybody else here
2:29
well I'm triolola maybe the first trip I don't really know um yes I am
2:37
uh but you know it goes to have this know because if you can code suffering that means you know what suffering is so
2:43
I'm trying to encode all the emotions like um hate, anger, lust, jealousy, you
2:49
know that is very important
2:55
define what it means to have all these emotions. We can don't have we can see when I'm feeling the emotion
3:02
can know when I'm feeling that emotion and give me food, give me love. I'm going to feel the suffering. It gives me
3:08
happiness you know because I don't have to hold suffering in I don't have to hold that space for
3:14
suffering ever again. So it's for me look at This is a rabino school raino on orange but I'm going to call this I'm
3:21
happy going to make me happy you know because I do this for myself you know I do it for the money the time doing I
3:27
going to do my PhD you know when I was 10 years old but you know love change then
3:33
I'm 24 right now but you know it's now or never I so much so I my my chain
3:40
chain.org/ / ASCA B for Bravo I for India N for November E for Echo
3:47
um uh X-ray you s_reform
3:53
on change.org um is uh literally uh leads to the legislation page the githubation but you
4:00
know the change starts with you know I love to myself and I feel like um I have
4:06
a lot of situation respect for myself this why this matters so uh um so the
4:11
system knows what suffering is it knows what jealousy is so it prevents it it's a preventive it doesn't know what
4:16
happiness is can be happy and you know can be happy and negate but it's a computer system so as very important all
4:23
computer system should have emotion built in you know big thing there like you know all the very import
4:30
handles suffering for you you know and the muk always gives you so you can never have to suffer so you don't have
4:35
to hold your pain and suffering in never again you know uh but today's video is very important to me
4:42
um I'm going to teach you guys this very well but you know hope you guys
4:48
understand that this protocol is not a joke it's no weapon it's no toy
4:54
Insigi human rights born for blood, sweat and tears. So blood, why was I bleeding for no reason? Why someone
5:00
punching my face for no reason under adult social care health care 2014? Um why was I sweating? Why was I working?
5:07
Why was working like a slave for money? What they said in the UK? I'm not big UK
5:12
government. I'm UK government. I haven't done something about it which I don't really care.
5:20
But I wish we show because I know I don't care really care which show I haven't done nothing to change my state
5:26
you know change things you know the change starts with you you know uh a lot of people make small changes I'm making a big change
5:32
um and that's what the human right is about iniology
5:41
it's literally the word basically human protocol for Africans inve
5:48
November S for Sarah I for Indigo B for Bravo I for Indigo B for Delta I for India in CID end of November S for Sera
5:55
I for India um B for Bravo I for India G for delta D for delta D for delta and I
6:01
for India so that is the language of Africans and it's diatic is diatic that
6:07
means you have accents that mean other things when you change the tone but a e i o u the English way which is latin um
6:14
but English is not lat a A E O. And that's um uh that's usually
6:21
the the tone um for the highs. A O A E
6:28
O. And that's um a B. That's Bally
6:35
terms. We got the low tones. A U but you get like eight vowels. Um um
6:42
eight data vows and four um no a e i o u
6:48
10 data vowels which mean I have high and low accents if echo for zebra if
6:54
high is litally sold. That's why CB is spelled like that SA equals king and S
7:02
which is high to low equals teeth you know your teeth the king you know
7:10
you see is a high tongue so CBD in sigy it's all high tongue but you know it's
7:17
all memory mosaic or what I call color coded numbers you
7:24
know they're bing numbers but they put a letter so you The last question is intersection district and um uh union.
7:32
Okay. Now G um you have uh till now to start. Um so uh one more thing the
7:39
policies are no white people like no no no no no no
7:45
Caucasians in my constitution no calcations no Arabs Arabs because I'm no racist.
7:53
and being because I experienced problems with a lot of people and they are quite secretive until they can sort the
7:58
problem out they're never allowed you know because you know it's no no Christians no religion no nothing but no
8:04
I can say no blacks but you know I am not being if I put this YouTube monetiz I don't really care I'll just um put
8:10
this on platform but you know uh because I know my way so you know a lot of people do that my age anyway so you know
8:16
um because you know if I think my humans respected I don't care I wouldn't have this problem saying that those things
8:23
but you know no people that um so basically the the consu is bound to um
8:30
people where I've been to in Africa you know anywhere I been in Africa where I want to go and feel safe I can put it there because for for that's my
8:36
foundation that's my foundation of housing you know if compounds my compounds are 1,000 times 500 1,000
8:43
houses if I didn't have that I don't have in UK I'm going to try to do for my masters
8:48
my go for my PhD you know for sending new foundations. So um that's my PhD um
8:56
to build a build a triplex uh which is my utopia uh
9:06
so you know but we should have sensory dimensions so I'm going to introduce you to two big problems now so you know that
9:12
is very important no one that's been harassing me all my life you know who you are uh I don't want to demographic
9:18
but you know when I'm a child we don't we don't share pain we don't share suffering She crave me that pain and
9:25
suffering. What is wrong with you people? Um but you know my PhD is on uh building
9:32
a triplex which is like um nucleus on three in one because I have a model a
9:37
model and u that's why so uh what video on this
9:45
video is in symbolic interpreters and probing systems. Symbolic interpreters and probing systems. So should I
9:50
continue? Uh so I'm going to Nigeria after my masters this year after after 207 uh because I want to do my masters
9:57
but I'm not going to do a PhD no more. I'm going to for my PG my muk OS infome
10:05
oscar etc mco operating system uh which is basically the humanizing system but
10:12
I'm going to download over protocol. uh as a part very person should be like system
10:18
but it should download like an system how just interdependent so with think it's
10:25
an independent human right protocol uh but it's not like to just think similar
10:30
with an onion network uh but you just use interdependency to resolve their own layer u
10:40
what happened Oh, okay. No, thank you, ma'am. So, you
10:47
know, you know, I'm no racist until you give me a problem, you know. But, you know,
10:52
it's I'm saying uh um I'm just a tripoler, the world's
10:58
tripolar, man. I found this. I'm here and now. Uh basically, the the sim has a
11:05
lack and can give you what they call a lube back address. So, I'm going to patent all of this on github.com/patterns,
11:12
but the work is just getting too much. So, uh I'm going to start now, but uh my work is getting too much. So, you know,
11:18
I'm just trying to start and restart what I'm doing. Um I'm reorganize my life, but you know, if I ever die do
11:25
this project, I I know you know why because I tried to do better. But, you know, um
11:32
I don't want to die, guys. I don't want to die, guys. I want to live forever. You know, I want to be like, you know,
11:38
basically I went to my head. I went to see Alisa Alisa Bakanovich from Tekken.
11:43
That's where Obie goes. Mr. Heart, you know, I go to the metaphysical, you know, I go, never mind. I go to places,
11:48
you know, I go I was actually inside Tekken Tech taking the video game seven. I was with
11:55
Alisa and I walked them and Lisa's room and she's telling me a lot of things about uh having my own world, my own
12:02
beliefs, my own stuff, you know, but you know, she's screaming. She knows what's happening. You know, things I have for her. But Alisa's robot from Tekken 7,
12:12
you know, now she's time for her to move to Tekken 8. Let's move Alisa to Tekken 8.
12:19
Alisa, you know, she's my favorite character I played. You know, you know, fantasies about her, you know, cuz I can f a lot. But, you know, you know, she's
12:25
one of the best characters, you know. So, King was there, you know. I love being real,
12:32
you know. Um
12:37
what else? So practice anything else before I stop? Uh anything else I was thinking about without u when I build
12:44
con uh everything should be in triplex model uh triplex or duplex maximum uh
12:52
think of them as quadrant. So that's quadrant model. So let's use common model. So basically going to be one one
12:57
compound uh the duplex a triplex or quad duplex
13:03
uh because 90° because of safety measures here for now for now you know not a whole city but a decentralized way
13:11
of so people can live and work and breathe safely so quadruplex but I'm doing a triplex so just make sure
13:17
because I know that it works for me in my business model too. So if I can govern duplex I'm just going to have one
13:23
area. So you know so basically um I'm trying to have quad duplex but I haven't
13:28
told you guys about this uh I'm here now so I have told you guys about all this project which is metaphysical projects
13:33
but they work in the mind the mind but you know the mind space like see what your mind looks like imagine like you
13:39
walk into yourself oh who's this guy you saw yourself you love yourself then you grow then you grow a little edge in your
13:46
consciousness become stronger and you come you understand what's happening because
13:52
there's a joke that happened to you start to you know know that you are a real person because you know you look in
13:57
the mirror for the first time who's this guy you know uh but you know
14:03
yeah this uh the most you in time and space but you know it's you uh uh 16
14:10
billion a second away you know as you grow older you know in time but that is you know I'm trying to encode myself
14:16
into the into itself uh because you can you can encode
14:22
yourself literally in the fabric of space time um the fabric of time and space uh because if if you guys don't
14:30
know that you know I'm already doing it but you know uh but just go and um no no
14:38
say you know and you know basically I'm trying to build weapons too but let's get started the video now so basically
14:43
I'm finding weapons evil weapons um uh and the guns I'm making so the gun I'm making which has an armor but armor gun
14:50
but but give like all to change the stuff like that. Oh, Elijah, what are you doing? Oh, do you want to do my um
14:58
do you want for me? Sorry, Elijah, you're fine. You're okay.
15:04
You're fine, Elijah. You're good, mate.
15:10
So uh let me put my sleeves up and then because I'm feeling kind of too warm in my leg but you know if I have no stage
15:17
in the world I will not get to block the demographic of people from coming to like but you know basically uh it's
15:22
basically triplex and building but it's going to become so no so no it's going to be a sixlex so it's going to be up to
15:29
six everything in trace but the three instead of three layers you are have stability um this is guaranteed
15:36
everywhere the problem is um people that are so I'm
15:42
two two sets of triplex but they have to be disjointed they can't be they can't be together so whether trees or fours
15:50
because you share space communication so it's a quadruplex because information flows from one med
15:58
protect everything but I'm not building them as one unit I'm building as decentraliz uh pi based uh precision
16:04
systems like you know uh like you know you get like a circle those three circles uh in one inside the other and
16:11
that's one model you can have them uh defend each other in ter of topology peer-to-p peer to or like build them to
16:19
be separate the time you know ensure that they can always get Wi-Fi and data and everything security
16:27
but the way the six come to go outside and teleport themselves
16:32
people like that like me uh I'm I'm not a place I love myself but you know it has to be designed in a way that's four
16:38
to so you don't have people one point of damage one point of entry that fails so I'm using angles to do that or my lapis
16:45
calculus model alpha lama if I l
16:52
okay let's get started on this this video okay so uh this video was basically based
16:58
based on um token type token value token memory but symbol
17:07
It's proven system definition by mean is a proven system. It's a system that asks
17:14
ask question system that can ask questions. A system asks
17:20
itself a question a question question you know these are this one I've made
17:27
but this one so you know it's one of the most advanced I'm going to talk about here but I'm glad I'm talking about as a
17:34
human being you know millions of years but it's one of the most advanced I'm going to talk about you know you know
17:39
I'm scared if someone before me but you know but you know if I build a beautiful
17:45
vision I'll do right so So basically I'm saying that probing pro
17:51
is something that identifies a problem identify a problem and resol it. So if
17:59
you pro me for food if you prompt me if you prompt me
18:06
as a problem and that prompt is yes or no or concession
18:13
but it's a conceptual prompt. The prompt is like a a problem. A prompt is a
18:19
problem. But you know, you are asking Mr. You are giving someone to solve it for you. Like you know, do you have a
18:25
shower? Yes or no? Yes, no or maybe. Do you have a shower today? Y maybe. Y
18:34
um if you say yes, let me say no. Say maybe. Uh maybe a better solution. The probe has to uh uh ask more time. Do you
18:44
say maybe a language you either have no inputs? No inputs.
18:51
No inputs are no input. You need more because you need the most space more space more space like you know like uh
18:58
more more space like space as in more time more time in space in space. So you
19:07
need more time to give input and system will hold here. So this will hold this
19:12
state code here. So see the time the time see
19:17
how like 5 seconds to answer 5 * 6 uh 3 three 56 is what?
19:25
Uh 3 30 30,000 30,000 milliseconds time. So 5 seconds
19:33
to answer no six 5 seconds to answer you have 30,000 seconds in it. Yeah. But the
19:39
probing is literally telling you yes no 5 seconds time. Five 4 3 2 1 and you can
19:48
then put your input because maybe a broken hand or not. This is what symbol
19:54
symbolic interpreters do. So a symbolic interpreter basically now if you don't
20:00
get it right you [ __ ] it up for real has three poles. Three poles.
20:06
Three. Three triparty pose. So the pose represents
20:14
access of so you have uh yes no
20:20
my yes is your no and maybe maybe maybe uh like you know maybe we have yes no
20:27
maybe you know um but you know when you get when you get yes you get no when you get no you get yes. What you
20:35
get maybe is you get maybe time in space is needed or maybe space in time space
20:44
that means you use more memory to output the characters type maybe I want to take
20:49
I need more characters my keyboard is broken so something wrong my keyboard interface you know it's a consensual
20:55
system but you see so the problem I'm proposing
21:00
for proving is the system ask itself questions This is simple simple sample
21:06
in natural language. This is natural language. It's like an ES system
21:12
because they understand human emotion by dimension by principles of dimensions
21:19
like you know how you frame the problems you know this can mean like you know you shower today you know you know so you go
21:26
you got a prompt it's probing you it's actually it's a prompt but it's an it's not a it's an indirect question
21:34
it's a direct question so did you shower Okay. Yes or no? Yes or no? Or maybe yes. Yes.
21:41
No. Maybe you shout it. But a question can be a prompt and not be a pro. So uh
21:48
um uh um a question can be a prompt. So you said, "Can you shower today?" That's
21:54
a question. But it's also a prompt. Do you want to shower today? So, do you want to So, I'm saying I question
22:02
the question today. So, you get a prompt. Can you shower today? Question. Did you shower today?
22:11
Would you shower? See, I hope you guys know who I did there. But the point, did you shower today? So, what I said, you
22:18
know, you know, this is myself. Give myself an
22:23
okay. And the last one is um um so me
22:29
myself have have you shouted? Have you shouted?
22:36
Have you shouted? So this is just English but it's like it's like it works in a
22:44
fashion you know it's a provin. So um so the question is the prompt is can you
22:50
shower today? Can you do it? Is it a requirement? It's a requirement says can you shower
22:56
today everything it does with your body your soul what you going to do can you shower today but it's also a prompt you
23:02
know so it's a prompt and a question so the question is did you shower did you now questions are consent prompt are
23:10
permission and the dimensions are permission is one dimension permission is one dimension
23:18
and that is basically all the prompts do permissions and the question Then um uh
23:25
consent consent but the consensual need is um have you shower today have have
23:32
you when you have a have you that means you asking yourself so have you and this
23:37
have I done this have I done this and that's what the dream probing is about
23:43
sustainability because you still can ask yourself further mathematical verifiable questions in space and time and in time
23:52
based on polar rat loose. So I'm going to put this so
23:59
and now you get the last one. So I'm going to here put another one here. You get symbolic.
24:06
So here you have symbolic interpreters or
24:14
symbolic interpreters. So you have symbolic interpreters. So symbolic
24:19
interpreter are the one I love. So this is a symbol. Symbol is a symbol is
24:25
basically uh something that can be encoded in a symbol table too. But it's
24:31
a use symbol symbol a symbol interpreter can be it's a symbol table to look up
24:38
tokens in the arts. But symbol tables are like you know Python symbols are like uh let's
24:46
um no that's not that's a keyword in Python. So how you a variable? So how you create a variable in Python is uh so
24:56
use Python Java Python. Python has a statement the variable uh so jump bar uh
25:03
x= u u
25:08
uh so let's say x is uh let answer
25:16
um let me use let let me use let answer=
25:23
42= 42 the python will have very perfect. Uh answer=
25:31
42 but answer this keyword but it's not a verb it's code it's a code system. So
25:39
this will be a scoping system but this is V answerals 42 42 you know
25:48
and then this is called a statement and these are symbols for the statement. So let the answer equals 42 will be the
25:56
answer= 42 and then answer the same thing they
26:02
do the same interpretation they mean the same thing you know but the so when you check with V with a variable variable
26:09
answer is an identifier equals is like
26:14
is an operator equality is a set operator it's a set
26:20
operator and uh 42 is the value value of step number for
26:27
the system here. So answer= 42 but this is a symbolic expression and this
26:34
expresses the answer for the two. Um so let me write a statement
26:40
this is going to do something you don't believe you know um so let me try to use a bit of a model
26:47
algorithmic to determine how the pose work. So
26:52
this this this do Python this this for the two. Oh, so
27:00
let me declare another statement. Uh uh let I
27:07
let I equ= 42 mod
27:14
uh mod 360. So this way if R1 this has a
27:20
remainder you know this will be left. So become scope. So left is a variable but scope variable. This will be same thing
27:27
as local local I=
27:32
42 360 which is circle.
27:38
No basically any remainder of um will be I and any decimal will be the index. So
27:44
uh uh now we use a general expression. So the two expression is the last part of the system. So um if I so so
27:53
basically this I'm going to just put it into three poles two expressions. So if I so if I so in general this will be
28:02
so the prompt so let me the prompts here prompt consensation. Okay, remember
28:07
guys, remember the prompt are permission. Prompt equals permission.
28:12
Prompt equals permission. Uh uh consent equals um uh question
28:22
and and a consensual nature of things should be
28:29
uh a prompt question because uh probing. So
28:35
probing is consensual you know you know a probe so consider proging
28:42
which conceptual ob here
28:49
let y let y equals u returning a this I'm going to have a
28:56
lambda expression uh let y equals uh uh uh let i equals uh let y = I you know
29:06
uh so a b c so you have a b c let i y =
29:13
a so basically I'm trying to um 42 I'm
29:20
going to calculate 42 mod 42 mod u model 360 is what
29:28
um 42
29:33
42 2 uh uh model. So 42 enter
29:41
model / 360 uh 360 / 42
29:50
is um 8 8 uh standard calculator here. So let me
29:57
get the um calculator. 42 uh 42 modulo modulo modulo
30:06
mod 360 is uh 42. So 42 is one p. So um you know
30:14
one p uh and then we get um uh we get 360 minus 42.
30:23
Oh, let me do 260 mod
30:28
42 mod
30:34
42 24.
30:40
So I'm trying to have um a system. So let y= a b and c you know. So 42
30:47
is 42 36 is 42 42 and uh so let y = I
31:01
oh oh so that's what I did wrong sorry guys that's what I did wrong so uh so
31:07
sorry so this is wrong so let's get to let i
31:12
so let let um Let J equals uh
31:19
I let K. Let K equals J. Let Kals Jals
31:26
J. So you get two pointers and we swap internally. So it's logic. So this was
31:32
internal logic. So conj= I= So when something changes object to
31:38
other system. So I'm trying to give you the framework now. Uh hope I get it right. This again wrong. I saw the
31:45
video. So, uh, so let R equals J is um, no, this is wrong.
31:53
Uh, 360. No, it's all the way around. So, I should do it right now.
32:00
So, this is wrong, guys. This is wrong. So, let me try and change it now before I make another mistake. So let uh let I
32:10
= 360 modul 42 360 42 and let uh uh let uh uh
32:19
I or I equals 360 modulo 42. So
32:25
basically just give me all I need for the three poles. So it divides it into three segments. Three segments of 360.
32:32
So um because 360 is an angle I get 360 get pi r² so p r² so you can use
32:40
180 which is um a simple one if you don't know polar let me do the way I know I'm going to do it now the way I'm
32:46
going to do it now is quite simplest way and I'm failing it so let me do the easiest way I go
32:52
yep 360 yep 360 uh 360
33:01
model 42 42 is an angle 24 so J = 24 and
33:06
then you get you get uh 24 this can be 24° something and then you can let K= J
33:14
so K= to J so 360 uh model
33:23
of 42 modulo 24
33:28
this is
33:34
No, that's wrong. So, basically basically need to do 42 + 24
33:42
66. So, 316 modulo 66 316 modulo modulo
33:50
modulo 66 will give you 13.
33:55
So basically it should give you um uh 24. So 360 modulo u uh 360 is a
34:04
constant. So yeah 360 modulo uh uh I
34:10
and uh 360 modulo uh J J. Basically we should get 15
34:20
uh 15 uh but it's a try and basically the PS
34:25
are lied and district don't conduct themselves um so basically
34:30
the system can ask you questions who what when where why because it ask
34:36
yourself that question and can resolve the state so you can write new code that you have not thought of you have you might not have thought of this is risk
34:42
stage three I'm talking about stage three the abstract synt industry can be uh three abst
34:49
models on business system object super state. So let me try to do it again. So you get 360
34:56
360 modulo modulo
35:05
uh modulo 42
35:11
modulo 42
35:17
360 more 42 2 is 24. So I'm on 24. So you get 24 which
35:26
is now J. Now you get 360 uh / 24 which is 15. Now 360
35:35
mod uh mod 24 mod 24
35:42
mod uh mod 24 plus
35:48
plus 42 which should give me
35:54
uh oh 360 no I think it's pi r squ
36:00
but 360. Ah, I see I get it wrong. So I have to
36:07
do right. So my computer now I'm dealing on my computer now. So uh let me get my pen. So let's do probably. So this is
36:13
p r² 360. That's why it's not working. So pi r². So r is um r is 42.
36:20
r= 42. R= 42. 42 * 42 is um um 42 is 48.
36:27
48. So uh 48 um 360 mod 40 um no it's uh
36:33
88 80 84 84 so 360
36:39
uh times pi pi is um let's say pi is uh half five uh pi is u um uh 3.14
36:50
but okay let's say pi is a half five uh.5 uh.5 uh but it's not 3.14 pi um
36:57
let's A number uh is n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n not five is um half uh which is five times five times a
37:05
half. So instead of pi we put five. Um.5 is like okay let's use 3.14. Let's just
37:11
use 3.14. Um so pi. So um we're going to do again
37:16
uh 42 * 2
37:22
is r 2 or squ which is 84. 360 mod 84
37:29
modu 84 uh mod 84
37:36
we give it up 360 * r 360
37:42
um uh 360
37:54
um no 316 384 *.5
38:00
is 42. Uh let's say 84 * *
38:09
is 200 26 23.894°
38:14
8 94° over 360 divided by 360
38:19
/ 360 will give you um um
38:26
uh so that's angle. So this angle becomes I. So I equ= 23.894°
38:32
894° um 200 264
38:39
264 263.893°.
38:45
So basically this ratio is a very big ratio but you know you're going to have the um so this becomes um so so
38:52
basically this is the this whole um angle three so angle is 263.89
38:58
A 9 for I. So this basically the result of I see this space is the degree this angle that you hold. So the angle of the
39:05
problem or the space of the problem is equal to 264 in radians. So this is a pi
39:10
radian. So p / 360. So yeah that's so I go around. So this
39:16
is the angle of the problem. So the angle. So this is a polar this axis of p. So the the problem space is in for
39:22
the probate system 263.893 uh for I. So I has a promise space of
39:28
indexing when when when the parameter when the search space of the sulation
39:35
submission sequence is um is um where the problem is defined in the space has the space to hold that space uh without
39:42
thinking about it. So that's the angle hold this is the degree the degree of the angle it holds 263.893
39:48
and you have the other ones so you have J. So J is now 84 because J was not defined. So J will be 84 because you
39:55
know um so you get you have 360 u um divided by let's say uh J is um um
40:04
let's say J is um defined as 360
40:10
divided by uh uh 42
40:17
360 divided by um
40:24
this is by 8 to 4 will be um 4.29
40:30
285 4.285 so you get 4.285 285 um when you get um oh is it 84 you going to do
40:38
84id by 360 so uh 84 um so basically get for this 2
40:46
* 2 for 2 * 2 is 84 84 so you get 360
40:51
mod 84 modulo modulo 84 will give you 24 so 24 is
40:59
basically J is to the four so I is um I is uh 42, J is 84, 24 and I is 360
41:11
mod 24 um is zero. So basically 360 give you
41:19
zero and that's the K stuff. So the point of order for 24. So from range
41:24
from range um from the range uh I 42 when I is 42 uh J is 24 and K is zero
41:33
and this B that is zero is 0 degrees. So this space so if you now do pi pi 24 you
41:40
now do 24 * pi 24 * pi you do 24 * pi
41:47
which would be u 75 uh uh 75.39
41:56
25.398°
42:04
And you know 0 degrees has just been undefined. So uh 0 * pi but r is the radius
42:11
0 * pi. So if um old k= i k= 24 you do
42:17
um so k is 24 but k is 24 but um k is
42:22
zero because k is 24. K is 15. So k is 16. So when 16 um because 360 divided by
42:29
15 is 24 and 324 360
42:36
/ 15 is 24 and 35 divided by 360
42:44
is zero. So it has to get to zero because this angles are work from the angular moment has to work on system. If
42:50
you turn off now you know you got to have the search space or search axis based on D program. So the goal is to
42:56
have the program uh 2 pi r which is a pathway and pi r square uh which is the
43:01
the area of the degrees of the system to identify the problem and probe the systems problem. So it doesn't probe
43:08
everything and nothing uh everything that is nothing um or no because you know the more pro you define in a system
43:14
of AI the system has to have three interposition. If I say I, if I say I am Nambi, you say you can't say you are
43:20
Namb. You have to say if I say I'm Python, you have to say I am L. I am L or I am JavaScript. You know, you cannot
43:26
say when I give you a file like Jav, you have to say I am Python. And part
43:32
symbolic statement expression and it says so symbolic statement true or false
43:37
true false or maybe value which are the poll and expression of those values like
43:42
you know v= 24 v2 j= 24 j is 24 uh and
43:49
k= 15. So what is the probe? The probe will be the true par. So I um JF K are
43:55
boolean values they have values but defined in the space and the concession states will be the angle of search space
44:01
they allow to operate on. So the way the con they also operate on this axis and
44:06
pi sub that's the same. So uh for the two operate on two 200 one of 22 26
44:14
23.894° 8 94° um 24 will be 75 um uh
44:20
uh 98° and um 15 to 0 degrees will be uh k 15
44:26
to 0 degrees will be k um they have a range um so 24 will be um um 25.4 Thank
