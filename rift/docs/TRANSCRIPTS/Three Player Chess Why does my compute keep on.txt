
Okay. Um, welcome back to my video channel. So, this video is on three
0:06
player chess. Three player chess. Again, that is three player chess. So, I'm
0:12
going to give you the the the down the the the brief overview. So, you got
0:17
dimensional game theory. Uh, games that work in dimensions. Um, sound volume can
0:23
have a treble, a bass, a low bass, a high bass, you know, but you know, a
0:28
treble, you know. instrument in the sound of music theory uh uh treble um
0:35
bass rhythm uh beats that um have rigid definition music theory uh but you know
0:42
they don't have um it's not music but you know if you got a master volume uh
0:48
you know the sound is playing or the noise that is there it poses those properties uh and you have to pull
0:54
signal from noise uh pulling signal from noise what does that mean uh making sense of things. Signal means sense you
1:01
can make sense of things. Um you observe it, you just read it. Uh things you know uh that has meaning in your framework of
1:08
things. So uh you got a signal which is signal mean something can do something uh a command and control system. Uh so
1:15
three players chess logic is basically uh dimensional game theory um which are
1:21
over games over isomorphic games uh like chess as to other games such as chess
1:30
checkers is to go checkers and go isomeorphic games chess is a bit
1:35
different game but it's a board game nonetheless uh but chess is to something else as um chess is to um I don't know
1:43
what game it is uh Uh but you know they share similar or the same roles by definition uh the same the same kind of
1:50
play style but you know uh the goal is to have them dimensions of attack defense and offense for the games. Uh I
1:57
don't use chess for example I only use checkers and go because that would make sense to me but you know you got the
2:02
chess tactics there. For example, you got um uh okay
2:08
the pawn uh you got like the the swap you get you look at the knight six knight you know the formations which is
2:16
the chess formations so the chess formations are like what I'm going to focus on today uh but they are um uh you
2:23
know you go to like um the when you so what you call the pawn the pawn forward and then you have a pawn and you have
2:29
the card guard of pawn that's a chess formation because you have a knight and a chest and and then you put a put put a
2:36
pawn forward and you got a knight um after the pawn. So you then that's the formation of a knight to pawn or knight
2:42
to bishop us to defend the pawn you know or get something from the pawn you know
2:48
um that's the formation I'm talking about you get other formations just like um uh the the the double knight
2:53
formation basically you got a knight a knight but you know a knight knight is a
2:59
good formation but you know that have to protect a sector an area an area of
3:04
interest um that's offensive defense you got an attack formation you got defense formation was the one I remember the uh the mighty
3:12
one. So you got the attack defense attack defense you got offense defense of the space there and get offense which
3:19
is like uh you know for more so you get advantage. So if there's an offense just not an attack uh
3:27
an attack. An attack would be uh um u um something that tries to position
3:33
yourself for an attack for for for trap. You know, this is kind of like a bishop
3:39
position a bishop position for uh for for an attack. But you know, you have to
3:45
lose the knight. So you use knight on the pawn, but you have the bishop protect the system of the system. Um so
3:52
you miss attack something to grab some kind of other bush you know if you give some
3:58
space the next turn in the next turn not the current turn the next turn you
4:04
attack something you have to have a turn and a turn but you know turn this game model so today uh the brief overview is
4:11
on dimensional game theory and three player chess uh because three players is basically the chess of real life I call
4:17
it I to you know you got three players and someone's not to play two play chess they smash the board ah they get angry
4:24
you know because it is real word anger I'm telling you guys you know if you've been if you've been with me you know
4:30
you'll know that even checking the go
4:35
the toilet you know they flush the chest piece in no I was playing that when I was 14
4:41
15 16 years old I'm saying to you because I was playing that it was like literally um annoying it was like you
4:47
know people taking went to his house. The guy was even nice. He was useless
4:56
because he cared for the people that people care for didn't care for it. He carefully put toilet
5:02
play, you know, have some fun. So we having fun with that probably one. So I'm saying to you kind of
5:10
like that. So if you have chess to me because of the war scenario and this happened in my um children that going to
5:16
play chess. Oh hey we're playing a game here because you know this another
5:22
player don't know how to get involved in the game and they adversar or good or bad you know you say you know you can
5:28
give you a hint like you know go I I move forward let me just let me help you move about entropy so what you knew was
5:36
kindally entropy dynamics so this why you play chess matters for this kind of
5:41
system but today I'm trying to formalize kind of a system of x operation
5:47
over uh over little and big Indian notation. Uh so let me show you my work
5:52
there. So this so as you can see here you got Alice with encoding. Uh so this is a left ending encoding one 0 01 and
6:01
the bottom one is one 011. This is Alice encoding. Let me get some water.
6:10
Before
6:20
I continue, uh, okay, so in the in the in the open, you get a laptop, a phone
6:26
and journal. So you can power your laptop from your phone. Oh,
6:33
so you get Alice one. So I put zero coding is 1 0 0 1 and then this is a
6:40
four binary encoding and get 0 0 1 which so we can start to command and control
6:47
this these are all instruction sets you know but they're not dynamic so the goal is to first make them dynamic and to
6:54
extend them uh as program so you can get this combination of this whole space so
6:59
so you have to um you're trying to get instruction sets um to dynamic
7:05
programming. So you can make this dynamic dynamic system. So it doesn't have to have linear sequence. So this
7:11
could be mapped structure explicitly without
7:18
detain explicitly declared state.
7:24
So Alice this is what Alice computer this equator by this instruction this is
7:29
what. So again 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
7:36
which is right in the notation uh you know most significant bits at least a little bit you know based on uh the loss
7:41
of polarity you know it from the but you know this is doable go to
7:48
github.com/obsis for oscar b for bravo I for echo etc for
7:56
etc/ r for romeore o for P for pop E for N R
8:02
open you see this kind of repository there
8:09
so you see that so this is basically a system of binary but you get Bob's
8:14
computer so this is a peer-to-peer network so Bob so Alice is speaking to Bob they are friends they're enemies
8:19
doesn't matter who it is it's just they are talking to they're connected they're connected
8:25
uh on the network so Bob's one is uh left Engine 1 0 0 1 and this is left and
8:31
is one 0 0 1. So backward and forward B one is isomeorphic uh but isomeorphic
8:37
reduction. So B doesn't need to be reduced again just need to be the power.
8:42
So my one or one E for echo Z for Z for echo is one1
8:48
uh and one zero one one 0 0. So basically the first
8:53
quadruplet of 1011 is a binary for my computer and 1 one is
9:00
my basically you can computer on from your computer by matching them with
9:06
exogate um and dynamic. So the good so I'm to use a dynamic program which
9:11
dynamic programming to allocate space
9:16
uh uh uh ahead of time uh via some kind of a sequences that hold something in
9:22
memory for me. Uh so enemy so when I need it I have it. So it's not like a you know so basically it's three
9:28
computers three computer at any time I can control one you know whether it's good or bad you know I can take over my
9:33
system I can al turn my computer on you know that's the goal. So uh it's a nonquid nonlinear sequence of
9:40
instruction set over time time where time is a priority uh not space the time
9:45
but the time for the processing is the dimension of a time but there's a tried
9:50
sequence of yes no and maybe uh they can use to resolve this within secret protocol. The goal of this to have um
9:57
first of all the first principle um a little big engine position over over um
10:02
x oper operand you know so basically you got an oper operator uh which is just
10:07
operating in and the operand which oper so the operator operator operand
10:13
operators are x exclusive or for each sequence of the maps Alice to Bob and
10:20
Bob to Alice uh but the key problem here so you know when you put this on already you can't uh have to uh switch to medium
10:27
you're on. So basically this is like a uh you have to identif identify uh what is what is this a gen IP that's being
10:34
rerouted or a static IP uh or still state a steel protocol a steless system
10:41
because you know it doesn't matter what it is you just tell it's on and off what so if it's on it's a circle it's a
10:48
circle it's running in dynamic mode in dynamic mode so dynamic mode supervis like system is running and s is static
10:55
mode is just doing boring It's not on the fly. It's not it's not doing something actively. It's not an
11:01
active active protocol. It's not actively doing it's not an active state machine. It's just it's just doing um if
11:07
it's active will be static. It's a x not and crosses. Not means it's static. Uh
11:13
cross um so not means it's dynamic. Cross means it's static or static IP
11:18
static MAC address. Uh static stuff. Um doesn't matter what it says is static. Uh so you need a probing system to
11:25
either detect it if if you miss on the fly verification which basically allows you to um um uh interject something. So
11:32
this is just a first model. So Alice can speak to Bob. Al can speak to Bob here.
11:38
Al can speak to Bob and Bob can speak to Alice by direct the people. The problem
11:43
here I'm saying is that I I can take the I can jump but you know I need to take
11:49
Alice and Bob's computer for my own you know uh but you know this is not a bad thing to do it's just my computer so I'm
11:56
doing it so it works my computer my devices but you know legally it works this basically a decentralized model of
12:02
interception system but it's goes for good use if you use for good for bad uh
12:09
because you already own something you really got to find so you can use for tracking you can easy for uh finding
12:14
tracking the stuff, turning your data off, turning easy for tracking this um
12:21
so this is this soft pointer. So via hard and soft pointer. If you have two hard pointer, if you have a hard
12:26
pointer, a soft pointer, you have to just shift the frame of view. So you can uh uh so if you have a hard two hard
12:33
points too hard and Bob and static or not, you know, you know where the device is. You point to the device harder. But
12:41
hard point all you have to do is continue switch. So switch point. So I'll do this for you
12:48
guys. This is kind of new. So I will have the so if my if the computer is
12:54
Alice I'm looking for Bulb I will give it a soft pointer which is and give it a
13:00
soft pointer and which is which is a which is a note uh I mean a hard pointer
13:05
I will give I'll use a soft pointer which is a note which is let it move so
13:10
it will be a note. So this will be a note X I'm give my computer another soft pointer I'll give Ali's computer if
13:16
Ali's computer is not missing a hard pointer X. Um, no. Wrong.
13:23
I'll give myself a hard pointer. Uh, hard pointer because I already know where I am. I'm stuck. I'm in that frame
13:29
of reference. But, you know, I'll give um I'll prioritize um the Bob soft pointer which is IP address. And then
13:36
I'll give him an X. So, he will be when I find it will be an X X. So, the X will match. And then you I'll give Alice
13:43
Alice an X because I already know where Alice X is. uh you know and given also the
13:50
polarity of the sequence will be uh the order of operations I have to run the x operand is uh north x for alice which is
14:00
means uh static and then and then an o so this will be the order of the vectors
14:05
so x so static static dam static then dynamic static dynamic so I have to run
14:10
a static position then in sequence series in series and then I
14:16
have to run Uh, I did have to run on my computer. Uh, two static XXO XO XO
14:24
uh XO Alice and then X uh uh uh X uh X X
14:32
and which is me NI and um and then uh if I start from my one uh um um O
14:40
X uh Bob. So um so uh so so basically
14:46
this is the protocol here. So uh the goal is to have this um system of X operation display but I am trying to
14:52
find Bob's computer uh because I'm trying to trace Bob my computer which is Bob computer. So what I need to do is
14:58
look at this index here and just put this up up. So it doesn't matter how I do it and I can use I can put Bob's
15:04
computer up. So this will be uh X I have to do um dynamics to static dynamics then static then uh and then I do uh
15:12
this one X then I do my log B mark. I don't even know where my computer is verify for just my computer at the end
15:17
of the day. So this one is used to verify this verify but you know the last one but you know on defraction so
15:26
bouncing you can check you can check yourself by so
15:31
um the verifier and the triple. You get um Alice. Alice does a so. So note then
15:40
cross and then uh and then is Alice is X then O and is SF. So this
15:50
three. So X n to cross n then note to cross um
15:59
cross to node and cross to cross. So that's say it works. cross because you
16:05
know those are polarity polarity of the XO operator. So for me the extra so the
16:11
next step for this so listen um I just forget to mention so you get the the uh
16:17
pro you have double the time and half the space double the time and half the space so double the time would mean that
16:24
you have the time double uh the time and half the space uh if the price is three
16:29
trident so uh for example uh you have um uh if the space is uh 1,00 1,00 1,000
16:38
megabytes or 1 kilobyte or 1 kilobyte you have uh and then uh half the time
16:43
half the time will be uh uh uh uh uh uh so you have double the time have double
16:49
time the full time will be uh uh 12 12,000
16:54
uh 1200 0 uh uh uh nano nanoconds which is two seconds or two seconds of time.
17:02
So basically this is time duality. So uh in a in for the four way to process this is um double the time and have the space
17:09
but double the time. So if you're pres if you're present in space you have to think about what is time equivalent. So
17:14
you you have to have the space. So you have to double the space be 2000 0 of uh
17:19
type type one autog type one type one type type one uh type A 2,000 of double
17:27
space double the space double space um um double space on how the time which
17:33
will be and how the time will be uh 60,000 seconds. So if you have a two
17:38
seconds to turn the computer on one two seconds when I press the button one two that'll be 60 seconds,000
17:45
which is 1 second. So that'll be um two um 2,00 megab 2,000 megabytes um or or 2
17:52
kilobyt over um calcul 2,00 divided by
17:58
uh 2,000 divided by 60,000 which would be 0.3 seconds. But this is for the
18:04
space space first the time you know. So you know I then have to calculate um the worst case of this. So this is the watch
18:10
case. So the watch will be in so this will be 60,000 uh the minimum space I
18:15
need is 60,000 space uh 60,000 uh uh so if I do um half the space half the space
18:22
will be uh half the space this is the best this will be the best case best case will be 0.3 recurring or 0.3 33
18:32
4 uh and then we get that and then we get half the space half the space would be
18:39
2,00 divided by uh uh uh uh 2,000 divided by
18:44
uh half the space will be half the space will be uh
18:50
500 uh uh uh first and then double the time. Half the space and double the time
18:56
will be uh uh four uh 12 to the four 500
19:04
/ 4 which will be uh 500 developed by
19:10
400 which will be um 0 500 megaby of
19:17
2400 2400 will be 0.028 028
19:23
to to uh space uh space to time then
19:28
time then time um because you know you get space and time and then this is this is the worst case I need the worst case of the space I need the worst space I
19:34
need uh or the minimum we call the minimum space um this would be the space that hold so this space is basically uh
19:42
what's allocated to um a negative one that's what's needed to do the processing at any given time so um so
19:48
this one will be you get the time first so the time will be half the time and double the space and double the space
19:54
and half the time. So half the time will be um uh 60,000. So half one of time
20:00
will be 12 will be 60 60,000. So I have two machines. I have two process two
20:05
60,000 uh uh no 60,000 no 60,000 60,000 divided
20:12
by uh double the space uh half the space and double the time will be divided by
20:17
24,000 second 400 megabytes or 2.4.4
20:25
kiloby so 24,000 megaby 2.4 Kob so
20:30
divided by is one pole axis. So what I call this will be
20:38
or and and uh and the other one which should be uh
20:45
this should be a half time and half time and uh double time and half the space.
20:50
So the this double the time will be uh this will be half the time half time double the double the time uh double the
20:58
time first. So double the time will be uh uh 24.
21:06
So no this is wrong double the time half half. So this is the mean time the
21:12
minimum minimum time I need would be uh 60 60 60 uh 60 uh2
21:20
uh 60,000 seconds uh two 60,000 seconds uh uh to uh 24,000
21:28
uh so the maximum time I need is double is double is double 12 so double 12 12
21:37
12 double double the time double the time will be
21:45
double the time will be so 60,000
21:50
60,000 * 12 60,2 is like um
21:58
6,000 600 0 um 12 0 0.
22:09
So 12 0 0 0 uh is double time will be uh uh double time 1200 0 * 2 which will be
22:20
1200 12 0 * 10 which will be 2400
22:27
0. Uh so this be the ratio. So you get the you should get a minimum space the
22:32
minimum the minimum time and the maximum time of uh the minimum maximum on xy
22:38
coordinate on you get the the you know the and you get the you get a mis of the
22:43
maximum the minimum space you need is 500 uh and then that be two m 500 500 um
22:52
megaby and then 2,00 the maximum space will be 2,00
22:58
megaby of space. So meab of space which is 2 k. So this is a two matrix of time first time time only first uh which
23:06
should be uh operating on time as a dimension of space uh time only space
23:12
only first you know if you need space if you need more memory so so the mission will be 60,000 to min so the goal of
23:20
this have this x operator uh you show that one more matrix what's the last
23:25
matrix of um of time first of time first uh these two matrix of time so of time
23:31
only first. Um so only time first um will resolve in space out of space.
23:40
So this is my math here. So my m here so as you can see
23:48
so this means so uh this is basically O this is Bob's one O then X X then O
23:54
which is Alice one and X this is my one. uh Bob Alice uh and then uh Ez
24:08
and Bob. So the D mode of Bob will be um in ter of this uh thing. Yeah. So it's
24:15
meant to resolve whilst processing while he's doing something. So you know because we already got the the units we
24:22
need to do calculation which will hold memory for that.
24:27
So, so how does this actually work in practice? So, how we put this thing here? How does this how does this bike
24:34
work here? So, I'm going to do the model again and the model will be so for me for me
24:42
uh so for me um I am trying to map Alice to Bob.
24:50
Alice to Bob. So, Alice has a one. Uh Bob has a Alice has a one. Bob that has
24:57
a a one you know one uh that means I need to get an operator called an X
25:03
operator to map Alice to Bob as Bob instruction say so Alice Bob will be
25:08
Alice Bob will be all so Alice or Bob first Alice or Bob one left Indian first
25:16
Alice or Bob one is O1 one is one uh and then uh and then S1 exclusive or one uh
25:24
exclusive exclusively Alice Alice Alice in respect to Bob because Bob is the
25:31
input. No, Bob is the input. No, no, Bob is the input. So you get the order. So the order. So I'm starting from the
25:39
order of the order of um Bob. So Bob is dynamic. So Bob is start.
25:47
So Bob is Bob is um so Bob is a dynamic. Bob changes. So we have to put Bob uh uh
25:54
in the uh It's not as second. So this is correct. So this isn't matter. So this is Bob
26:04
is we don't know the time. So if Alice says yes before Bob
26:10
say if we don't know we can be Alice and Bob. So if Alice Bob is really on
26:19
no Bob the super position of on. So maybe it's on. So we've calculate Alice and Bob. Uh
26:26
we've got two. So Alice and Bob and Bob and Bob. So do Alice and Bob. So you see
26:31
how the machine matches Alice and Bob. So this Alice computer being off uh after Bob's on. So this value. So one
26:39
one O is one and then we got uh O and then we got X X X. So Alice one will be
26:48
uh is off. So when you on or off? So Alice one zero or zero.
26:55
So if Alice is one uh and has a one is one and Alice is one. Bubba is a zero.
27:01
Alice has a zero and then uh and then the or alo zero and then the or is zero.
27:06
You get a one zero and then you get uh uh and then you get an exclusive or
27:12
exclusive uh O make a zero a zero uh and then a one or one zero zero and a
27:18
zero and a one a one a one. So you get a resulting matrix of a zero result vector
27:25
of uh Bob uh to Alice having a one and a
27:30
zero in this room and you sorry
27:36
and I have a one I have a one so you know so basically this bally this is
27:42
basically how it works so I'll the first one here so this first four device so
27:47
let's do the first one so this the first dynamic silicon so we have to go to silicon sequence already done. So, so this x
27:55
also done. So, we know the table of lookup table is one zero which is just
28:00
like for the vector but you know can be the opposite one you need to flip it in case of pop. So, uh so this is one zero.
28:08
Let me do the other ones now. One second guys. Let me just do it first. I'm going to show you guys. So, you get this one
28:13
here. So, you get uh Bob is a zero. Bob is a zero. Bob is a zero.
28:23
Uh Bob is a zero. Alice is a zero. Uh Bob is a zero again.
28:29
And uh oh zero uh zero or zero is zero.
28:37
X 0 is one. If Bob is static is static. So
28:43
we get if zero. No this is X. This is one Z. So if zero is one
28:52
zero is zero. So 0 0 we get 0 one uh one
28:58
and then we get to one zero and then one get 0 0
29:04
0 one and we get that's just the above mapping
29:11
I do my mapping too. Get to zero. Then we'll get to four. Four 43. I'll get to
29:16
zero zero. Get to zero. Uh 1 2 3. Uh get
29:22
to zero. Zoo
29:27
zoo zoo
29:42
zero zero.
30:01
0 0 uh 0 one one zero
30:08
zero
30:13
uh Get the last one. Uh, so the last first stripper to be one
30:22
one
30:28
zero one one
30:36
zero 0 one and this one is one. So basically the resultant is different
30:42
from the input. So you have to hold the resultant. So what you hold. So my
30:47
matrix is so I see you can complet one. So this is this is uh the data the
30:52
output is one zero uh uh one 0 one 0 one
30:58
and then this one is one one but that's a sequence. So you can get um the kind of dynamic resolution for the system. So
31:04
for this the first set of of quadruplets which is um Alice to Bob Y is one 01 and
31:11
Bob is 1 01 and the left endiness you get this model of one zero which is a
31:17
vector vector you can use to um get the message whe
31:23
to the computer to Bob and vice versa and one zero is a vector 01 is a vector
31:28
one is another vector and one one is a vector so these are the four vectors you get uh 5:00 four vectors you get when
31:36
you pop and you get one more more thing which is um so this is the is vector
31:43
vector. So this is the vector you get. So you get one more thing which is the change. So I have to now get my mapping
31:48
to the system. So I have to now uh now verify that um this new vector is done.
31:54
But this vector is already done. So now I have to do this kind of system here of
31:59
so if I get uh uh uh uh uh al
32:08
xo so I'm trying to get operator that will work and that's the x operator that will flow. So that's operator I need so
32:14
that's can do so the exo operator remembers the state the stale state. So this what this is the proto this the
32:20
medium this has medium shapes uh that I can talk to. So I'm trying to change um
32:27
Alice Alice uh Bob's one uh uh via Alice. So I can change I can just try to
32:33
find so I need to find so will be if Alice is dynamic. If Alice is static and
32:39
Bob is dynamic I have to now get Alice. So I'm get I'm change Alice one. So I can change because I already know where
32:45
Alice computer is. So that'll be static to dynamic or static or static. So I'll just pick static. So if I turn this one
32:54
be static is static. I really know it is already static. So it's xx. So I do one
32:59
x get 2x. So uh so
33:04
to do so for my one to be one I need right now. So my to be um my
33:16
one to be let me just try and write my result. My result is my resulting vector
33:21
is uh 1 0 uh 0 1 uh 0 1 one
33:29
and then you get the other one which will be this is right side. Um the the other one will be
33:36
uh uh uh my one will be uh Bob which will be static. So we static
33:43
on uh so on. I can so my one will be uh my will be will be uh uh one.
33:53
So my one which is one which would be uh one which would be 01 10 one and there
33:58
will be one 10 one 10 one 10 one 10 one 10 one 10 one 10 one 10 one 10 one 10 one 0 one will be zero or zero is zero
34:04
and zero or one x 0 one zero you know because my one is
34:10
static and this one is static and my one is dynamic so because my one is dynamic
34:15
so uh uh so to arm arms
34:22
you Alice is my computer. So, so let me start again. So, if Alice one is one uh
34:28
zero one zero uh one I mean if at least one is one and
34:35
my one then my one will be on and off. So be my one will be one and a zero uh and zero. So my is I want to keep on. If
34:43
at least one is one, one uh or one is one. One or zero is one. One. And then
34:51
that will be the state for O. And then XO zero one or one. XO XO one or XO one
35:01
and one you know exclusive O. And then we get Alice's um so this is the first
35:07
set of down. So the so I'll get one. So get um get alis zero to my zero then a
35:15
one. So it's internal one I mean so this is a dynamic
35:21
this is a static x uh so so zero or zero is zero zero or
35:27
one is one be zero one this will be
35:35
this be 0 one this will be uh one
35:45
One zero zero. Um zero uh zero zero
35:52
zero one is 0 one 0 one is one
36:00
0 one is one zero or one is one.
36:08
So 0 or one is one but 0 0 is zero. And
36:13
that be 0 is one.
36:19
So then 0 1 1 0 is one. So that one here. Yes. Come
36:29
in. I'm busy. What you Okay. Oh, thank you. Uh Charles, I'm
36:36
coming. Thank you. One 0 one is one is one one
36:43
this is one and my one is one that will be uh uh uh uh as one is one. So it's 1
36:50
one one zero that would be uh one uh one
36:56
one one. So uh as you can see the time now is uh 37. So uh so
37:04
this is uh Alice and Bob Bob X.
37:11
And this is my one. My one will be uh uh uh one zero.
37:17
Uh no, this is one one one
37:24
uh one zero one one.
37:31
So basically this is Alice and Bob. Alice Alice
37:37
Alice so this so you can see Alice. So I
37:43
have this Alice here. So my So you see so I need the So I'm going to connect to
37:49
the computer of Bob now. So I've already done Alice and Bob. Alice connect to Bob because Bob has computer. So I can use
37:55
Alice computer. I can use my computer to connect to to Alice. Uh but you know I can now use my so I have to use my
38:01
computer to connect to Bob and that's the last thing I need to do. So I so this so for the matrix I got 1 0 1 1 0
38:10
uh 0 1 0 0 1 and 1 one one which is uh Alice to Alice connected to Bob's
38:16
computer and for for me to connect to my computer for connect to for me uh for Alice connect to my computer uh and me
38:23
to have the power on uh you know the power on uh for both
38:29
at least Bob B power on and then at least to Bob at least to essay uh and uh
38:36
uh am I my computer to be power? So I'm the one I keep my computer on which is a
38:43
I'm to keep my computer on. So you know I have to turn on all the computers that keep my computer on. So this one 0 1 0 1
38:50
0 1 1 uh 0 one. Okay. Okay. So one one so I guess one one not one zero one one
38:58
0 one one and one one. And this is a computer of Alice Bob. Alice Bob. This
39:03
Alice to this exit to Alice or computer on. So the one last to do is before I go
39:09
to lunch is the other one which is um I'm watching anymore guys. So last I
39:17
have to do is uh uh what is it? So oh no
39:24
I lost it. I lost it. Hopefully not.
39:29
Uh so so so the last to do is uh uh the
39:35
computer system of pop to uh
39:41
of pop two.
39:47
Uh so I can't find it. So uh that's what to do. So I can't
39:53
I just lost what I work. I just lost it. I just lost it. So I think to lunch now
40:02
I haven't found. So yes I found it. Um yes.
40:09
So I haven't found no I won't find it. So you know I have to go to lunch today. Now I'm in the war so I cannot miss this
40:15
launch. So uh uh so you know if the resulted force is um uh so again the the
40:21
goal of this I have your computer kept on my computer kept on uh so you know I am trying to if I find when I go to
40:27
lunch now I'm going to find the the thing I need and that thing I need is um
40:33
the food I say so the food comes first then I can then continue
40:40
the goal of this to have your computer kept on the power on so you have to have two states on and off and keep your one
40:47
on. Uh doesn't matter your one on. So the on the on will basically if I want to keep my computer on that mean one one
40:55
one if I'm if I'm if it's connected to and this is just a this is a vector. So
41:00
uh the vector my one will be one one uh uh one one which would be two matrix.
41:08
So this will be one for uh exit to Alice and uh for for uh for for Alice to Bob
41:15
if there's a need for Alice to Bob to keep on you know because dynamic if I really got some encoding in Alice
41:21
computer and I really control Alice computer to switch on that will be 01 01
41:27
which is a vector which is a vector and one one which I keep to the system one. So these three mics are what I did to uh
41:33
keep my system on and keep keep a command and control system via uh
41:38
control via via uh three player chess. Thank you guys.
