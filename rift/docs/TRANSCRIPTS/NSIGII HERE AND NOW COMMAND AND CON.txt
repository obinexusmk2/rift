NSIGII HERE AND NOW COMMAND AND CONTROL KONAMIC AN IMPLEMENTAION INDUCTION

Um, welcome back guys to my YouTube channel.  Um, today I'm doing this my train of thought  
0:13
to this uh uh YouTube uh music uh train  sounds. Okay. Uh J today time the date is  
0:22
um uh the the 13th of January 26. The time is  now 6:08. um 6:08 p.m. Um uh you are watching  
0:33
OB Nex's um YouTube channel. Um I'm still here,  you know. And now, uh this video, uh one second.  
0:42
Am I looking at the right? Um yes, this is um  this track has been recorded speech call uh  
0:48
for/ dictate. Um continue session continue. Uh uh  you know uh so this video we won't be proving the  
1:00
uh what's hold but we giving a brief overview  of what's up what's to come uh cuz this incig  
1:08
protocol uh basically seems to sound like incidi  uh the protocol protocol but in sigi because it  
1:17
has some meaning which I forgot you know uh but  it was one of the persona of essay when I made it  
1:22
So you know incibility is an isual language uh you  know but that's where the foundation of uh cuz um  
1:31
influence inc uh which is a human rights protocol  uh for safety critical um so I'm going to give you  
1:39
talk on it but I will not implement the proof um  uh I'll implement the latter this five part series  
1:50
um five part videos uh for this series but I'll  speak on the protocol now. Uh CBD is a language  
1:58
that was in that was native to EO was native in uh  was native before the Nigerian precore language.  
2:07
uh we uh we are the EOS we have the um the symbol  for EO uh because I is diluted it's not it's not  
2:18
colonial it's more of um easy to grasp but it  isn't in a nutshell it is what it is uh is is  
2:28
ninja Congo so it is um non it's a language  that's been um been uh been well integrated  
2:37
societies because it works on concept work in  the in protocol. Um and for SSA I for India  
2:51
G for golf I for India I for India uh this is  inigi uh inigi is a human rights broker again  
2:59
uh it is a trident model is a trident model to uh  to migate um correction uh but it is got my notes  
3:08
here I should be looking at my notes too uh but  don't be looking down so y so uh on um is a spoken  
3:21
uh uh CB African agency uh has a part list uh  which computer codes um hard to do uh but in uh is
3:35
address the pointer problem. Uh the pointed  problem is uh the problem uh in computer science  
3:42
are formulated uh of what um is being run uh via  um threading concurrency it it is what holds in  
3:51
memory what they share or share uh for example  breathing and living uh breathing in doesn't mean  
3:57
just breathing air uh breathing is not optional  and if a point of breathing miss is misses  
4:05
um that means someone is uh a hungry for dying  uh and it's not living and if it's not living  
4:11
that means they have been breathing so  uh breathing air can both breathing air  
4:18
uh uh breathing air and talking um a pace breath  um pace breathing like I am doing right now  
4:27
uh it's meant to ensure fluidity and flow in  the system uh uh these are the pointers so the  
4:33
pointers of breathing and living must hold in all  contextes. Um if the task involves breathing and  
4:42
um but if the task involves work the point u but  it's not allowed to stress the force the person to  
4:50
work because working without breathing living uh  uh uh is part of fatigue and confusion fragmented  
4:59
mind. So sigy is uh has the is not a worker it's  not a work broke it's just it's a human rights  
5:09
brokers breathing and living uh but the point is  that the share of course work out there so they  
5:16
can ensure that it remains under breathing and  living it holds a demographic state u uh and holds  
5:23
a negative space for working uh because working  uh becomes easier when there's space and time
5:35
so as a policy now is a human  rights program under living
5:42
constitution uh coher um uh as I am speaking  now so uh I'm not going to rush this video I  
5:53
will take my time to do it uh because I have  all the time finally here in my house by the  
5:59
But I don't have protein. So uh how was um CBD?  Uh why in CBD? Uh uh breathing and living uh you  
6:11
know breathing and living life is what we all  do and we don't need to ask permission to do   it. Uh we don't need permission. We don't need  consent and we don't need consensus to do it.  
6:22
We are all allowed to breathe air free of thought  and this does not be fragmenting the mind and this  
6:28
one matters. It stops the pressure that is the  the mind race of new average mind you are under  
6:38
pressure to do the most basic things uh that  will normally do and still make mistakes. Uh  
6:45
a sigy resolves all of that. Uh example uh humor o  for mic for mic for umbrella k for kilo for o for  
6:56
sorry is a operating system that um that people  can download this operate system u uh and it's  
7:06
a here and now protocol and command and control  protocol uh uh it is blood spot and tears which  
7:14
are the pointers uh the pointers household over  arbitrary rules because um the the pointer problem  
7:21
is very important to do. We have semantic uh drift  um or leical drift because um each of the par can  
7:28
drift to some extent and this what is meant to do  uh when large binary over an insecure proto HTTP  
7:39
or HTTPS depending on how you feel how you feel  the should be uh um but blue share is a download  
7:48
blue shell the polygon system is what uses as  Cannon stick over a Wi-Fi system. Uh here or now
8:00
power life balance come on neutral. Yes. Uh so  um how does this work? How's the So how does the  
8:11
the action of here and now reflect in single how  does this work here and now or essay or or king  
8:19
has a point to his data his phenomenology  data his data he shares with Obi and Obi  
8:27
can create destroy can create and destroy and  conclus for Charlie H for h for means knowledge  
8:37
Hebrew means king or leader and ob means heart  or soul in these two are what I call those who  
8:48
are actors of the proto and communication by  communication by design. Uh they are speaking  
8:55
on this program but they hold a state um of life  work and breath uh uh life breath and work uh uh  
9:04
work work uh life and breath is the worst order  that they can all be in. The point of problem  
9:12
uh ensures Ezer addresses his problem in his  domain uh via commander control and holds  
9:19
automographical statistic. Uh Es being king  or leader like everyone else can hand parity  
9:27
uh to the system. Uh for example um as a uh  has a problem uh as a um uh and turns his one  
9:37
zero one to zero. He's zero. What is going on?  Thankfully it doesn't sound like this. No no
9:48
sound. So um so sorry uh let's say has  a problem is knows a lot but um problem  
9:57
so must open and open sensors so  can't sense them and safely so
10:08
is first likes to do things so we open  motor compliance for motor so what  
10:19
is double the space for motor uh and half the  time. Um uh and vice versa the time to the space  
10:27
uh this time space time uh represent the  the amount of allocated space in memory  
10:33
uh via token kind and token value in rift.  We have three triplets token type of the  
10:40
value token coin that is validated as as.  So token uh value type uh is a token type  
10:50
uh the type of a token being evaluated by the  rift uh philos but they share a token value and  
10:59
a token the share the share token value and  token type token value and a token uh data.  
11:08
this uh data is to determine whether something  is something or something can act on something as  
11:15
an entity and that's what the framework of come  um how this work is uh for example which um has  
11:26
three packets of data that can be in a mic state  of color state of red green and blue as it has a  
11:35
red and blue color number um for them to agree on  the message package they share a trident package  
11:43
uh because the trident packet dictates how the  message was sent. The trident packet is a coil.  
11:50
It's it works like this. So given the state uh  the tomographic state of um red green blue uh um  
11:59
um red green blue um they share uh share a  dimension of that problem and that dimension  
12:08
is the color consumption between red and blue  red uh the the two reds um light red to dark red  
12:17
um based on hue saturation and lightness. Uh the  hue of the red is the color coding the old share  
12:24
when they mix they're both red. Uh the saturation  is another color code when it mix both red and the  
12:31
uh and the lightness uh is is what they share when  they when they have um the red, green and blue  
12:38
uh model. Um the pointer here the red and red and  blue are pointers to the stage. Uh if Ezie drifts  
12:51
uh he appears more red. If u drifts he appears  red on to because and sending a message that  
13:00
needs to be uh uh so when they send messages and  they agree uh get the messages um agree they make  
13:09
sense to each other is verified it is green and  green is a a consistence check. Now the blue is  
13:17
just the chemical state of and there is nothing  of everything to verify cuz they are both moving  
13:24
away or they're moving and move again. The red uh  can be um this planer can be red or right there  
13:31
or right or blue but green blue means they're  moving away uh moving together and the message  
13:39
is no green until it's sent and verified via  zero knowledge proof because depending on the  
13:46
cell so on terminal this is validable because  red uh red and blue are the color the pointers  
13:55
to green And they anchor a green tomography state  that is measurable neon cyan uh yellow magenta and  
14:05
uh and brown not black is black will be nothing we  can see nothing uh but this is all brown no gray  
14:14
so brown or gray or gray because no it measures  the kind of information uh and the k is for kilo  
14:20
v kilo kilo means a thousand of uh to see how The  vision was shared over 10 uh whether to share the  
14:28
ratios how the ratio was what via the pro the pi  fus uh using a to theographic pie to do it the  
14:35
lap integration of this is beautiful for the power  of ox stop uh definition an oxtop is an auxiliary  
14:44
stop uh sequence and series sequence in series uh  that's what it is um the otop is um basically If  
14:55
you want to start a system, it uses electronamics  um electromagnetics to via electron dynamics  
15:02
principles uh such as thermodynamics dynamics via  magnetization uh because uh it pro it propagates  
15:13
an electric pulse system like a magnet and uses  that magnet to turn on computer systems on the  
15:20
fly without humanation. This is can be like  uh right up uh right left up down uh AB stop  
15:30
uh uh and this is a um not a commodic code I think  it's wrong. So let me try to find a conomic code.
15:44
So um
15:50
Konami So the Konami code is a famous chico.  Yes. Blah blah. So the uh uh so it's up up down  
16:02
down left right left right be a stop. Uh this  is the canonical code. Uh and this canonical  
16:10
uh represents a signal milestone in the um  development of the product. Um the canonical  
16:16
code is used as on the fly command and control. Uh  but let's get to how this works. So uh a trident  
16:24
packet. the the pattern which a token uh the  verifier is what OB has the ground to verify  
16:34
uh very because he doesn't like to show Omi  replies and send to V observer and just um the  
16:46
observer just ask and is local observer because  he is the one that sees everything that is not  
16:54
uh the sees how the system works really from the  inside out uh uh but he's observing the state  
17:03
tomographically without being directly involved in  the command and control um concept of it. So what  
17:11
this means is when send message to uh receives  it and you can check it and you can send a reply.  
17:20
uh this can be a kind of uh kind of an email  message system when one humans on the loop but  
17:26
it's not needed no human on the loop it's just an  automated system the code represents the command  
17:31
and control aspect of it uh sending some kind  of option to a computer system uh to turn it  
17:38
on is what the goal is uh it's basically uh with  stage 012 which is a positive stage stage three of  
17:49
uh stage and beyond uh for relay relay systems.  Um so uh for example uh C red the sh of red  
18:01
uh h of red uh which and uh c the message have  verified and they are sure they verified. We  
18:12
can ask for the verification packet and see what  Obi has to say about them. uh uch and uh uh and  
18:21
e will be harder. So the goal of this is to show  uh smooth fluidity in the system. It's my really
18:34
am I done with this? Uh this kind of um here no  I'm not done with this. Um so the kind of saying  
18:44
um we can work on are synergy waves uh sing  waves are a problem via the Ryman hypothesis.  
18:51
The Ryman hypothesis uh is a signal equivalent of  measuring of a strict structure of the message.  
18:58
So the kind of message has a structure or state  but that state is an imaginary number and the  
19:05
Ryman hypothesis allows you to verify whether the  number was determined via Cisco which is bottom  
19:12
up of breathless search or risk uh top down pa  uh bottom up uh and we don't know verification  
19:22
uh uh but the the pauses are are uh the  goal is to have a camp state of the media  
19:28
where sister is marked to risk such that there  is no interpretation of information and that's  
19:38
the new that observes as green or or green  without actually measuring OB is going to go uh  
19:48
um you see the the so how this work in practice  okay uh if using the email system without command  
19:59
in a traditional email uh in a traditional video  stream uh like this one here. You can start with  
20:05
the stream of the buffer without a buffer and  if you could wait the video it starts buffering  
20:11
uh the buffering is a standard procedure but  you know uh but you know why are we buffering  
20:16
when the video is downloaded that is the problem  the addresses are all via MOS. up. For example,  
20:24
download that loading becomes a problem when you  have a slow bandwidth per game. And the problem  
20:30
of the artifact, it can't it can't happen more  than the bandwidth unless you know this is what  
20:38
is trying to a so how does this work? So send  Obi uh L. Obserie gets um the option to play  
20:49
uh uh 80 one of 80 video games or live and play  um or watch um uh one of 80 uh videos you know  
20:58
you know at a time while they download you know  this is OS um it's meant to work because of the  
21:06
onfly system because the more videos are working  the more to skip and wait for the operators to  
21:11
download uh v on the offly system. Um the goal  of this is literally to uh using colorcoded  
21:20
mosaic rhyman shape to determine the color of a  pixel ahead of time. The computer observes and  
21:28
uh uh actively observes uh which can active  uh actively observe uh observe and act
21:41
determining the trajectory of the computer  system. Uh it's an infl program cuz the computer  
21:49
uh the color of the pixel uh without a blind  stop as it's bound to radio frame which distills  
21:57
all the colors it's observing of the user  and the data to red and blood. There'll be  
22:03
no blind spots in the radio model because  by design pixel everything that is there  
22:10
um no as the radio is uh if the current  so uh we have talked enough about the  
22:18
um the uh the kind of how this work in practice  uh uh uh in practice you will use setting field  
22:28
instruction uh but these are like rift microfiles  uh the refiles and these rifiles are important  
22:35
to determine the trajectory of a system via nucle  coherence. It's meant to be the most form of self
22:46
it's meant to be the most authentic  communication uh because the Alexa allows  
22:51
you to speak authentically in your own way. No  matter if a mark's voice or or not, it's meant to  
22:57
speak for you. You can speak for it. You say you  can't speak for it. You know what I'm saying? Um
23:04
So uh the so the K cluster of the system   uh works by damping. So the dumping  factor of the 0.85 because it's basically  
23:14
um rough theory but K clustering uh uh  nearest neighbor uh is for dimensional
23:24
uh is dimension it's interventional. So uh  what does this mean? So the chlorine because  
23:31
of loss of information the product must keep  learning and that's why the dimension has to   evolve via program. Now the term active  means active state machine. Uh the term  
23:42
sparse means many models all within data and  type sparse means you know what you're doing.
23:53
So the term class means uh the system knows  how to behave. Uh term active means to pass  
24:02
model. Um the term active passive model. Uh  the term active means the system knows what  
24:09
you're doing passing via a stale protocol.  So the protocol is remains and never ends and  
24:18
becomes still becomes in a state of um certainty  because it knows what it did and how it survives.  
24:27
So to increase that state to be probing  cuz probing enables the air system to
24:36
to live without via a GG pres.
24:51
Oh no. Okay. Watch YouTube on your TV. So the  sn waves um are how the so the senior waves  
25:03
uh so you have the t three one two three you  that down and you put another three the system  
25:09
doesn't reject it it just it just um tries to  understand it and then move on because it is  
25:16
not a threat to it so it doesn't need  to do that and that's the whole thing
25:23
So
25:37
can see.
25:44
So um
25:50
how you can
25:57
Um okay. So this
26:04
so the token kind and took a man uh because  they migate n uh on null exceptions directly  
26:14
because they mean to be there of the poll.  No, Neo means something country something is
26:24
uh uh so kind of polar. Uh let's  pause because we mix. So uh
26:37
to hook um so what else we got here?
26:48
So yes so we got the two. So the protocol is  also command and control protocol. It's used to  
26:58
uh take over a system in real  time on the fly while doing it.   uh which is a kind of a powerful concept to me. Uh  for example, if you have a a boomerang or terminal  
27:10
and you chuck it up in the air vertically,  you have star uh this back could be oxar or or
27:25
um say so so it must be um down to the so it must  so the really uh system attack is not a hydrocar.
27:40
It starts having a gravity well. Gravity has  an area radius before the system come crashing  
27:45
down on itself. Um but the woman is normally safe  because you know this is happening. So uh if you  
27:52
have two hoops in place of sparse missile uh one  of them must come down one of them come down come  
27:58
and say miss or not food water uh without without  f and show and how does this system work so  
28:09
uh system defines an instruction which is uh  executable instruction set uh as something  
28:16
that's directly executable by the system. It's  on the fly but it's a it's a command and control  
28:24
uh uh uh political information for kind of a small  missile uh because the missile goes up and down  
28:29
but run around and the system must pick up this  of this missile and then actively deal with it.  
28:35
It will not it's just a a Facebook that  what is intended because the instructions  
28:42
are are not being hijacked but they  either been ox started or listen to  
28:48
uh or started you know do I don't tell  you to bring the instructions we shuffle  
28:54
uh we met um they are new instruction  for the people who are like
29:05
So the kind of so you go up and  down up and down go up or down go  
29:11
left or right you know it goes up or  down but you know goes up and down.
29:28
So,
29:38
so
29:57
command system uh allows you to do. So the  goal of this is to load uh while the system  
30:03
loads uh have some kind of triggerment  to the local instruction and turn this  
30:08
off while learning through the system  that's system it's active pro system I  
30:15
don't the same it's there because  it work the state the is Oh, no.
30:32
So, let's put this down here. So, what have I  done? So, the the the the human program is command  
30:40
and control program. What that means is can  intersect things that are flying in the air space.  
30:45
It has cuz you know what is verical going over  so much it's It's an on the fly pocket that knows  
30:54
other steps and then it encodes the basically  on the big screen. It takes the instruction set  
31:01
watch YouTube on your TV on a system of a noisy  system or noise star uh which is a noise star  
31:07
if the system is flying uh and using an oxar to  inject your sequences to turn off a system like  
31:16
midflies while you have to hack the system while  it's online offline and that's moist star you  
31:22
know if it's a physical star or physical table  or use via calculator in time via calculatorul  
31:30
in real time uh uh real time trajectory um to  keep the system uh open. So the goal of this  
31:37
is to have an actual radiography read system of  the command protocol command control protocol  
31:43
to article because you know argue me so the  article so uh I just need to find a [ __ ]
32:02
So human proto is there. Sorry  I'm slow. Oh, so so you have
32:15
so you have a um
32:41
So anyway, so here it's an impreflight. The noise  basically have no signal. No noise. No noise and  
32:52
no signal. Uh noise, no signal, no noise and no  signal. Uh noise signal. Noise. Uh no signal.  
33:03
Noise signal and no signal. No noise and signal.  No noise because you know it's a fourway point. No  
33:11
noise means there's no noise in the system plus  times union uh noise cuz this system is just a  
33:18
state of everything that can be noise. This  is the power of the system and this no noise  
33:24
um means you have no noise and no signal. Uh  you need no system no destroying you system to  
33:30
listen to stuff without being the no system is  not is not is known. So you kind of said uh the  
33:45
no signal and the no noise is a framework for  safety pre-comment for tomorrow. It's made to  
33:56
um to the subsystems that that are believe in  hostile via the hostile dri cluster is ensures  
34:08
that the system remains coherent while the  system is operating uh uh via um page ranking.  
34:15
uh but the page ranking is uh ranking not rough  pages uh but density um like you know kind of  
34:23
authentic use of the system the protocol in  the first place and why it was meant to use  
34:28
is basically prioritizes the two point life via  entities uh trading entities via so no matter how  
34:38
much the board is say can only do what it's  intended to do and the verification happens  
34:44
uh you know in which I music can start a radio  station with up to 30 artists. Go ahead DJ.
34:53
So my days don't look into this. So the kind of system I'm  saying it it works because it's powerful. Now  
35:03
ox dot is geometric auxiliary star but do start uh  is not the noise star because standard no sequence  
35:11
no no noise signal which is no information coming  into the system to noise stop you know but the it  
35:21
depends on the state but it depends on the state  all depends whether the computer is on and off.   So if you have no noise means your you have the  system is on it's possible the position state  
35:31
is on or off but that on and off depends on the  context of the old stale state uh via the active  
35:39
and sparse model. The same for the no noise um  noise um no signal uh from the computer system the  
35:48
color or anything uh on standby or or other things  hibernate which means the system is regulating  
35:56
it resources uh and sleep the system is off for  short time period as a policy the goal of this is  
36:03
to show that the share system between the systems  are isotropic now means isomorphic and together.  
36:11
The humorous protocol uh is um the first part of  the thing but the command and control system is  
36:19
a real time uh strategical algorithms that operate  on events properly uh you know you know um and you  
36:28
get sentences that are recursively like um pizza  picked the pickle pepper and you know because the  
36:34
systems everyone's done this ones but you know the  you know the system um this is a valid procation  
36:41
But but the message is um uh can the message  so is for revival via program. So uh uh other  
36:53
things um final say um so uh uh furthermore uh  uh we had the AG pro life cycle of uh double AG  
37:03
set one double the space in memory uh and had a  time uh ahead of time and tried it ahead of time  
37:10
uh for computation and half the time to do that  task we show a star scoring of 01 which is space  
37:17
and time polar inverse duality for type one and  eight HDH processing uh via the compliance of  
37:25
new divergent uh in the loop system. Uh we are  to also um the the ins program also prioritizes  
37:35
where's my clock here? The secret protocol also  prioritizes uh prioritizes uh these definitions.  
37:46
uh a processing uh a processing is the act of  um executing an active system knows what it's  
37:54
doing without uh uh without probing for new  solutions. Uh probing is when a system tries  
38:01
to create a solution based on new structure that  is new set of instruction that solves a problem  
38:10
um that solves the same problem um or new way of  doing something. Uh so the system proics has a  
38:17
way a way uh a sparse algorithm a sparse data  structure via cartation and polar coism a way  
38:25
uh to uh navigate a system that has been diverted  to another course alo it's a probe that resolve a  
38:34
pathway shape a probe shape to a p a probe wave  which is a pathway um via polar and cartisian a  
38:42
probe shaped to look at the shape that the the  the OA uh via the geometric structure of the  
38:48
path they're going like the map the probe shape or  the probe map if you want to call it the mapping  
38:55
of data um uh so the shape refers structure and  the structure is half so structure is the full  
39:02
shape and the shape is half the structure uh and  the pro every pathway via polar lapis so every  
39:11
pathway which the two pointer way so the two point  of reference uh uh for the time um the pro every  
39:19
pathway shape and form the form of the data uh  like the form like a codc form the codec uh this  
39:27
could be a cisco model uh which is the cisco model  uh is a bottom up starting um bottom of a self  
39:35
balancing tree that prioritizes two ples at the  time shared by the top down model via instructions  
39:43
set uh and operator coherence. Operator coherence  is the shared mathematical verification and zero  
39:52
trust principle. uh which means that the ZKP out  of is very viable between Uchia and Ez and who  
39:59
have uh uh uh token roles roles to fulfill uh uh  via the the pro um interface because the system  
40:10
uh uh a platform that he doesn't know uh system  must um resolve uh uh on the fly uh is safety  
40:18
critical uh such as accessibility uh or or macros  definition uh oh or sorry these are all lexus and  
40:28
psores uh that have calico uh uh assembly uh  uh assembly um uh which tell which really the  
40:40
calico pa uh has all share assembly definition  which can be deassembled or assembled in Cisco  
40:48
models and risk models which are the relay the  system to observe instructions in real time and  
40:56
giving you the structure of that instructions  uh via the updown protocol because the protocol  
41:02
is on the loop uh it's on the fly protocol.  It allows you to literally send uh command um  
41:09
like a input executable input via tele mosaic  um event sourcing. So what that means you can  
41:18
uh it bubbles up to the code and that bubble  is sent while it's being executed. For example,  
41:26
if I press um left right up down that that  uh that um to to to have the the IPO target  
41:35
um the go up down left right up. If I have this  up or down, if I press up up down down, left,  
41:41
right, left, right, ba, and I and I and I have  um the send um the send code uh preinflight,  
41:49
the the the telemetry system uh has a UU ID for  me and E me and OB knowledge and Ez can send his  
42:01
package to to verify it. But this is just the  first test. So this rift left to graphically  
42:08
up up down down will be up and down uh for but  these are instructions for again. So I allow  
42:14
I allows me to control an arbitrary entity uh  via executing instructions that are on the fly.  
42:21
uh this is a just in time compilation that uh  when the instruction is not execute because  
42:27
the instruction hold executable logic uh  in real time and that is what's being run  
42:36
uh uh via backnoff notation uh reverse  uh back which is um uh uh uh postix so  
42:43
uh so postix um but the post Q50 is um you know  it's executed last executed so there's an execute  
42:51
um tradeoff here the time to execute. So you know  it's basically a buffer before you can execute it  
42:57
just to make sense the film can actually be an  execute active for. This is up up down down to  
43:04
control a system in real time that uh is either  being really intercepted or um or being updated  
43:12
u because these are instructions uh that humans  can control intuitively as a symbolic interface  
43:20
like BA and then sometimes start or select uh is  a sequence of instruction. Now the sequence is  
43:26
u structured uh is what you need to boot a system.  uh um as a person of this person the sequences are  
43:35
in the series which are uh combin because they  are all combinations of um heterogeneous models  
43:43
uh uh via analog and uh system interface  depending on how you want to inter
43:53
so in my first imitation I'm hoping uh to uh  I'm trying to um implement an auxilary thought  
44:00
uh start again does things in half so they execute  in halves. Uh so the example uh again so if I set  
44:08
it up up down uh back forward um can code um I  expect some uh kind of receiver to uh act on the  
44:18
system and read the code um up up down then to do  something right left right and aba and then stop.  
44:26
If I if I have um uh if I have up up down down uh  the system on the end is moving up up down down uh  
44:35
some kind of like a pong game. It's moving up up  down. I think I want to do an SDL uh VR rift. So  
44:41
the goal of this is to have four uh test cases uh  two positive false negative uh four two positive  
44:49
u false negative false positive force negative  that actively uh updates the state on the rule of  
44:55
kingdom basically on a new on a in a on a shell on  a ripple but this ripple is playing pong pong but  
45:04
the the with some kind of delay. So the the the  goal of this is to control one system for another  
45:10
ox dot. So basically the ox dot is a scalar is a  tensor that's half that takes half a dimension up.  
45:18
So you can think of it like half a dimension and  that half a dimension double the space in half the  
45:24
time it will execute. So um uh half the times  you have to you have to um press enter twice.  
45:30
So you have to send it twice. So if I said if I  press R it's already half executed. Um but if I  
45:35
press up again it's a send because you know specs  two it goes up up and that is a send. So receives  
45:43
two up input this sequence of up down down.  So if it's two down it's now sent one down is  
45:49
half instruction but this half instruction being  sent right left. So right left will be I mean left  
45:56
right will be uh one left but this these are ones.  So this is um reference should not be set because  
46:01
it's half. So so this one is one direction and  now press uh left right left right and you left  
46:07
right left right it is now set. So you see that  sequence sequence instruction you now press BA.  
46:13
Now BA is bound with same plurals but B is a B is  a button and A is a button. So it's not so just  
46:21
um explicit stop the place and stop uh a stop for  the button. This can be for switching games in  
46:30
the com which are control executable instructions  on the fly because they are arrows. They dictate  
46:35
um they're basically game controllers analog uh  digital they model the systems coherency over  
46:42
sparse tomographical resolution. The goal of this  again is to get something token type and token  
46:48
value to act on behalf of a series and we got  we can send other messages over the protocol and  
46:54
horizon crystal automated stuff. But the goal of  the system is to deal with every end of u very via  
47:01
macros via meta rifiles the meta control sequences  uh uh and the riff files um via active because the  
47:10
goal of this mucos hasn't been downloaded ahead of  time it's good buffer because you know this one is  
47:15
downloaded the mucos will preserve that state  demographically and it's still calm codes it's  
47:21
meant to literally be an on the-fly interpretation  of the system and the community code of the  
47:27
point problem. Okay, one more thing, one more  thing. How does spring work? Uh math is from
47:36
springs. So, um I'm looking at spring. So, yes.  So, uh spring is damping. So, the press play. So,  
47:44
I'm looking at um a simple mosaic motion  and damping. But the spring have a sign  
47:51
uh function they define and the physics index  spring. So uh so this uh the coil interface  
48:02
um oh sorry so the first equation so it's balance  of spring balance that measures weight and force  
48:12
by how the spring moves. That's a spring balance.  So the you can see the I'm the spring balance  
48:18
um in the framework of organizers because spring  physics is what it goes. physics index. Uh I'm  
48:25
looking for the spring um type of forces. Uh  the type of forces um strong force, weak force,  
48:31
how does the spring work? Uh uh spring physics  uh unit uh energy and power um uh radiation.
48:48
Oh, um sorry. Um um so uh so the the  kind of uh uh so I'm going spring so  
48:57
the the the muk is you have two  packets that send one does the  
49:02
the spring how does the spring work  um so uh imagine a piece of strap
49:12
if you put it with a finger it is a stretch coil  it is called this is a spring core algorithm  
49:17
around the pen or a pencil can make itself  perfectly as fine Now you push or pull it  
49:23
with a spring. You can feel the stress squeezer.  It's quite easy. Uh but you know this what I'm  
49:28
saying. So you take a paper clip you roll around  you make a spring simple coil. But the but why  
49:34
is it stubborn? Why is this spring is reason to  stretch and squeeze or why some piece of uh metal  
49:41
of the wo and why is it so reluctant to change  state in the first place? You know uh try bing out  
49:48
spring. So the goal of this is that this is more  of the the springs are way a way of storing and  
49:54
absorbing energy. Uh so when you push and pull the  force when you are pushing or pulling the switch  
50:00
you are using the force over this you're doing  work you use energy tell the spring the harder it  
50:06
is to the phone so it's hard to the phone for the  spring uh the release cream basically it maintains  
50:13
the energy uh uh lucco uh basically the kind of  spring for I'm looking for uh the spring because  
50:21
spring um is is a system uh that takes That's  what it was. So to learn how to laugh again
50:35
with unlimited data for social media on Voxy  mobile selected social apps in UK TNC. I think  
50:41
I didn't do it. Did I did I did I no I didn't.  Okay. So the kind of thing I'm saying is the code  
50:49
is meant to represent the spring physics framework  and spring is the system that uh handles the the  
50:57
the the spring how does a spring work physics  uh six physics uh physics spring um I'll look  
51:07
at the spring I'll look at the formula now uh for  formula for a spring uh the f of spring but the  
51:15
spring is a coil and coil for is what it's small  on moment. So uh the the is basically uses the  
51:24
the system force equals half * pi * the over the  kilometers meter over the surge uh the damping  
51:33
and resonance spring failures m and prevention  fatigue overload corrosion you know buckling
51:43
repeated cycles can lead to formation and growth  of microscopic cracks uh uh a seed Springs start  
51:51
can cause permanent deformation or breakage.  Uh corrosion environmental factors can spring  
51:56
over time relaxation. Uh but this is for sending  messages. This one works automation try them. So  
52:02
has a coil. He sends out a coil you know if if  it get if you get stuck it can send information  
52:10
uh to get the uh the stuck on some system but the  information recoverable and that's why the spring  
52:16
motor some of the function recover and that's  why the spring core m interface so you got the  
52:23
noise stop and the ox stop and the ox stop uh  and you got the ox no signal ox signal ox no  
52:30
noise and ox noise um because those are state  of on and off based on the kind of standby of  
52:38
the system. Okay. Okay. Thank you guys. Thank you  guys. Thank you for watching and um uh hope you  
52:43
guys love this video. Um uh uh remember uh may  the rift be with you and secret is here and now.  
52:52
Command and control uh relay systems. Um have  I got anything right now? No. uh uh uh via high  
53:01
lapis priority cuz the goal of this is to ensure  that everyone can get some kind of food well when  
53:08
they need it in the BF uh anywhere everywhere  or some sparse missile mal in the organism. Uh  
53:21
uh breathing is never optional. Survival is  never optional. Uh living is never optional.  
53:28
Only working is optional. Uh living being  alive is never optional and only working  
53:33
is optional. Thank you guys. Um uh because you  know you got to put the screen down. Thank you.
