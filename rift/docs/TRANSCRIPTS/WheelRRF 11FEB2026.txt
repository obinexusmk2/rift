Today is Wednesday, Tuesday, Wednesday the 11th of June 2006, the time now is 2.59am. So I'm sitting at the Phoenix ward, in a private room, literally, with nothing but a hospital, which is my belonging. It gave me, it's in 5th term, but it only lasts 13, from the 13th of, from yesterday, from the 10th, from the 10th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 13th at 4.42pm. But, you know, that's what the video's about, but, you know, I'm going to do something now, because if I don't define this properly, it will not work in front of us. So here must be a problem, for everyone, and anyone, let's be a friend.

So I'm going to free you guys by using my cashier model, you know. My cashier model doesn't let me go here, but you understand, freedom, freedom has come with a price, like literally, freedom has come with a price, you know, it's free. So you have to fight for it, that's what you have to, that's what you have to fight for, so it comes with a price, so you have to fight for it.

So literally, you know, it's normal to be that way, but there are other ways of working, so, so you can see, because we have other ways of working, freedom comes at a price, you shouldn't do, you shouldn't do, so, the solution is just to have the invariant process, invariant process never change, so, it's on, it's on, it's on, going, you know. I'm from Zimbabwe. I'm trying to make this on the baseline, so people like Nnamdi Kanu don't get detained, I love Nnamdi Kanu, but you know, he got detained, but he was fighting, and I haven't seen anybody kill anybody, but you know, I'm Nnamdi Kanu, but I haven't been detained, so I'm using him to encode him, of me, into the framework for being accessible.

We have the bi-directional clause, bi-directional, so, you know, I was detained for housing, you know, these are two opposing stories, like, he was, he was a freedom fighter, he was a fragmented freedom fighter, fighting without a legal system, fighting the system, but he wasn't fighting the system in the way I expect him to, you know, but he's not a scientist, he's not a, he's not a tri-polar, but he wasn't fighting the system regardless, he was rebelling, but the rebel, he was a rebel, but he was rebelling in a kind of history, because, you know, it's there, you know, but it wasn't working out, you know, because he had armed people, I want people to have safety and security, but I don't want people to have weapons, but I know how this works, I've been doing it, I've been doing it since I was a child, 40 years old, so, you know, what I'm proposing here is, what I'm saying is, it's a rhetorical reasoning rational framework, here, so, we've got this model here, so, it's operation bound, so, I for India, G for Gulf, I for India, I for India, I for India, G for Gulf, I for India, I for India, so, as a model, as a set up, I for India, G for Gulf, I for India, I for India, it's an operational protocol, I'm going to play some blue noise, because, you know, some brown noise, because I, you know, I'm a philosopher, I've been doing this for so long, and it doesn't make sense to anybody how I'm doing it, basically, it doesn't make any sense to how I'm doing it, I use a lot of, you know, it's literally, human rights, it's like, so, this is the truth, the main reason it's not, well, it's an operational protocol, basically, it's basically, it goes about pushing the bar, you know, it's not happening on your computer, it happens in the real world, it's a big thing, it's a big thing in the real world, it wasn't like that back when, it was a big thing, how it's dealing with states, like, you know, things like ideologies, such as, racism, into a framework, you can formalise things like that, into a framework of this protocol, you know, like suffering, pain, sadness, anger, that's basically what you're handling, you must hold that for you, indefinitely, by holding that for you, basically, yes, no, and minus, minus one, maybe because, this is what's done, can mislead us, and will mislead us, most likely mislead us, if you don't fully understand it, and, the fact of the matter is, that's what comes to mind, in most cases, you know, because misleading is a big thing, you know, so, you have to have a clear picture, a clear mind, you know, I'm easily misunderstood, I'm mean, I'm never minus one, you know, because, I've been chained, but I'm not, I'm not out of belongings, I'm not out of things, I'm out of hope, I'm not the same person as you are, I'm not now, so, it clears off, but you know, I really question my identity, it belongs to me, so, you know, I'm not rebel, I haven't killed anybody, I haven't got a gun, I haven't committed a crime, and if you're not with me, it's a three, without, without, looking at me as some kind of crime, without a crime, I can't charge you, I don't know, you know, you see, and, then you come out, it doesn't do wrong, you know, but, I don't have any reason for that, because I don't know, I don't see, I don't see the line, dedication should be, so, you know, no matter if it doesn't do wrong, but I mean, which I believe, you know, the, the radical, the radical, the radical rationale is of human rights, it's a business, it's a business, it keeps you there, because, if you are, you are more or less a slave, and, by slave, I mean, you are, you're susceptible, like you're, you know, you're more of a, a, more susceptible to labour, you're more, you're, you're seen as less, so, not slavely, not making you work for it, not making you work for it, because it's something that makes you do, to comply to it, and, you know, the, the down is that, yeah, this is a down, the freedom, yeah, so you have someone that's, oh, like me, someone that's rich, like me, kind of, and, you know, the duality is, their bones, their humours have been violated, you know, so, their square is in the box they hold, so, this space is, box, and this can hold you, or you can hold, hold them, you, how do you want to see it, you know, you can hold them, they can hold you accountable, you can hold them, so, that's what it's going to do, it's holding, it's holding things for you, while you're doing this, so it's a peer-to-peer model, so, more formally, it's a peer-to-peer model, so I'm poor, I'm being detained, he's rich, he's outside, so, I'm poor, I'm poor, I'm nobody, I'm being detained, I'm being wanted, I'm being detained, and he's rich, someone's rich, you guys are rich, you know, you guys are wealthy, when you're outside, so, you know, so the political models advocate for me, I'm in advocacy right now, but I'm not getting advocacy, I keep requesting the same things, and the same things, that I suffer, find it difficult to do it, and I find it difficult to do it, but, they're not being, they're not complying with it, trying to tell me this is where I belong, I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I never do, I never will do, that's what they're saying, so, I'm trying to code myself, into a framework, as, as a sort of like, you know, shelter, food's not optional, you know, a need, a need to pursue, it's time-bound research, you know, it makes, it makes you suffer, it doesn't like, global warming, because it's a protocol, it basically, allows you to, get food, but, you know, get food, you know, from where you're from, it doesn't matter, whether I get transferred, to a new world, or not, but, it can be sort of, a session, an entire session, because, you know, the world is basically, a home, a place to keep you, you know, it's huge, it's really true, you know, because, you know, it does work, yes, it does work, but they don't want you to comply with it, and, you know, that's why, because it does work, you know, and you can be chopped off, a piece can be chopped off, your hand can be chopped off, and there's no discrimination on you, because you're there for profit, it's a, it's a for-profit system, and you cannot fight, fight without having a fight, and that's what OBDX is, it's a human rights business, it's based around, it's around people, it's human rights, it doesn't want to be wrong, you know, and human rights in general, you know, but our, our, our authority, anybody that claims they're, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, because I mean, so I have one, I could see, my nose 1, to 1, to my eyes, to my nose, to my eyes 1, my nose, to my mouth 3, my ears 4, my skin, my touch 5, 5 says my taste, my taste, my taste, my taste, 5, 5, 5 plus 5 minimum is 16, 5 plus 5 is 10, 5 plus 5 is 25, So, for a particular person that didn't break the five human rights, which is not enough, it's not enough. So we're going to add the six human rights, just for like, in case we get anything wrong, you know, so she never breaks, you know, because you can actually write extra, one should, you know, to define, you know, framework what is wrong. So, to really formalise this, you know, for every part of people. 

For me, I have a, what was it, four, I have a eight, so an eight minimum, so five, and so I'm tripolar, so that's those human rights, because I have a sense of direction in the kind of being here and now, past and future, present, here and now, and there's these three people that represent me, you choose here and now, but he resides in the past, you know, he's the one who resides in the past, he remembers in the past, Ezi is here and now, but he resides in the present. So, you know, I should be Ezi in the present, because I'm taking that persona on as Mr King, leading the way, because I'm here and now, and there will be eyes in the future, the heart and soul in the future, but the heart and soul is here and now, talking to you, but it's the same thing, I mean it, in every moment of it, you know, the pain is as much as your sword, whichever is the pain, as if it's a sword, you know, and then OPI moves the heart and soul, moves your heart, so you don't have to hold your heart, you don't have to hold your heart, you can breathe it, you know, but you have to hold the thought accountable for what you do, you know, I'm saying, so the rhetoric of this is that there's no reason, there's no reason, there could be a reason to hold someone, but if you have a moment where, you know, I have to pass my, I have to call my lawyer today, to see whether my lawyer can get me out of here, but, you know, if my lawyer can, then I can have to stay here, because sometimes I shouldn't, I have to, if my lawyer can either, you know, give me out of here on time, I don't like that until, you know, when I go to Nigeria, this is a sort of a testament to me, I'm a tribal, I'm a tribal myself, you know, being me, because I have, in case you weren't aware, so six of us are still, you know, because I have, oh, five, six, seven, eight, yes, I have, I'm tribal, so those are three people a month, so I'm still not in human rights, so, you know, because it's a fight for me, me, myself, I thought I was saying that, something else about that, but that's one reason I haven't, but anyway, computer, it's, it's, it doesn't need data to compute, it's something to create, and it's computable, it's not unverifiable by the system, and so, there, it must be, it must be included in the system, I don't care whether it's a nasty book that we didn't, when I see the problem, it's been coded, it's been coded, like, you know, for example, if I go to the gym right now, I can meet you, and that was a community, I'm not a member of the community, I could go to the gym, and then, and then I could use the park to exercise, I don't need a gym, I don't need someone to exercise, I could just exercise, but I want to be in a gym, so, if the, if the gym, if the equipment, if the park is public, and then park wise, two people, I'll use it, two people, no data, you know, but you know, if there's no equipment, I'll use it in the, in the closed space, in the indoors place, but it's not a good thing to be, I've got stuff, you know, this is basically, I'm saying that the gym, for example, Michael told me to do stuff, I write the new stuff, you know, write the exercise, and then me being here, being in the gym, I have to ask permission, you know, and it's not the same reality, there's no, there's no reason to refuse me that service, which I'm doing here, but I, but they're not doing it here, they're doing it in the gym, they asked me whether I want to go to the gym, I do go to the gym, but I do it, but you know, I can't be doing that, going to the gym, if I have to call lawyers, you know, and people, you know, there's no reason, so give me section 2.5, you know, give me here, you see, it's simple, you see, it has a whole kind of space, you don't, so you don't have to, you can start thinking properly about your way out, you know, but you're going to have, not having a service, you're going to have, this is probably, you're going to have a service from the people that are going to support you, basically, through networks, so you're going to have one for them, with this position, you get the change, like someone, I'll say in the constitution, you have automatic arrangements, you get a laptop, you get, I think it's the shelter, where you get quantities, you know, you get, and it's what you're going to have, what you need, what you want, like I'm pushing you up right now, someone with DSS has seen you, but we're not going to pick you up, we're going to get you out of there, we're going to get you out of it, in time, in time, don't expect to see them, we're going to keep you there, we're going to get you out, that's the problem, that's going to get people out, they're going to be detained, actually, issue with the system, I'm going to be working on this, I'm going to be working on it, because it's the best time to work on it, you know, it's like, you know, my hands are fine, my face is fine, but it's the best time to work on it, my computer, but you know, they're going to have you, all this stuff, something, but you know, when you're not, when you're not, because I'm, I'm UBI in the future, UBI is in the future, you know, but he's here now, he's going to be here now too, so again, the future is now, the future is now, the future is now, the future is here, the future is now, so UBI, my third persona, I'm bipolar, so you know, five, six, seven, eight, there's three personas in me, so I have three objective, relative, three objective, no subjective, three objectives I share, I can go to places in my mind, you know, I'm not daydreaming, I don't daydream, guys, I'm navigating the system of the real world, I know you're right here, you know, I'm not stuck in my head, you know, but I'm well, the kind of hoarding of authority, it's a whole suffering, pain, anger, it's not what they call it here, human being, and I can't, this is what I can't defend myself, you know, but the, because it's about financially, because it's a human rights protocol, but human rights protocol, you don't put any money to solve the problem, you just keep money out of the lawsuit procedure, you know, online litigation, so litigation is the, so basically, return of the purchase is a litigation protocol, ensures that, you know, this one, I don't know how long it's going to take, they get money out of the system, they direct, mine was three years, mine was 12 billion pounds, for a council, you know, three years of my life, so 12 billion, I don't want 2 billion, 12 billion, they have to pay for that money, whether they like it or not, they have to pay that money, you know, so it's only to pay for anything now, because, you know, and the other, all of you, the businesses got screwed from it, you know, because they didn't want me to just throw it away, ask them to do my business, you know, but business is the human rights, the first human rights law, everything is bound, every business is bound for human rights sovereignty, obviously, you know, because it has to be identified by the social governance, so by social governance, you know, if I'm some rich, I'm poor, I'm in a box, it doesn't matter, I'm working, I'm working, or I'm human rights say, I want to work, I should go to work, because that's an official framework of not being, allowing to know that, so section two here is seven, eight days, but eight days in section two here, so after section two, I cannot be on the street, I cannot be on the street, if I'm not around, so I'm keeping away from everyone here, for the time being, but, you know, the rhetorical is, there is a fact, it's a lived fact, you know, the fact, you know, the rhetoric is that, you know, it's a lived truth, it's a reality, you know, the reasoning refers to the dilemma of the problem, you know, the reasoning between what is the reason or no reason is, there's something that doesn't want to budge, you know, there's something for human rights that doesn't want to give in, and the rationale behind it is all money, the curve, the one on the stamp, the ability of someone being, but we don't want to do it the wrong way, we don't want to, so, you know, because my rights have been violated, so my lawyer has issued me that thing, but, you know, my lawyer has to give me that, my, um, otherwise him to, to free me, but after this, I'm going to, I'm sorry, I'm going to, my first situation, uh, before, uh, maybe don't turn my, uh, one second, guys, yeah, so, you know, everyone should have everything, uh, like this power bank there, it's an optional, uh, no codes for security power bank, so, the Nucleus OS, Infobank, Infobank, if you want to give a key, or for Oscar, that's what, it's in my solar system, and this is a bank, so everyone gets, uh, uh, Nucleus OS, uh, power bank, uh, power bank, uh, to, uh, okay, so, Nucleus OS, Infobank, Infobank, it's a human rights operating system, it works on new divergent human rights only operating system, it's not banned by anything else, you don't have to go online, because, you know, uh, you go online, so I don't see the full picture, uh, based on art and design, so, it's, it has to work with this power bank, so everyone gets a power bank, you know, uh, external power bank, you know, for the, for the, you know, tablets, and allow the devices, you know, should allow, three devices, allow, um, a Nucleus, a Nucleus, or tablet, this is a human, this is a human, it's 10, but this is, it has a, it has a, go right, go right, it's got a pin here, uh, but this is the, well, this is the, uh, sample of the, um, I won't look at a bill, but, you know, usually you have to get the money, so, it's a young tablet, you know, but, you know, it's a young 10x10, you can see it's kind of dirty, you know, it's a 10x10, but, you know, this is a sample of a tablet, and, you know, when you're there, you know, you're allowed, when you're not allowed, you're not allowed, uh, a laptop, you don't get a laptop, you don't give you, uh, your personal stuff, in case of communication issues, you know, a tablet like this, but this is a new type of journal, so you're going to be in a journal, uh, be in a journal, so I'm going to try to, um, put it up, it's going to be wireless, you're going to be allowed to, uh, log into your phone, and send it, as you see fit, uh, you know, but you can't, you don't speak to any AI systems, you're speaking to an AI, um, symbolic, um, system, you're not speaking to a human being, uh, in the loop, um, that refers to the system, and that's a dispute, as I said, I find it difficult, difficult, I find it, uh, you know, as a matter of fact, if you're a lawyer, you're allowed, you're allowed, uh, two lawyers, let's say, uh, one from, one lawyer from the, uh, from the place you are from, primarily from Brazil, and a lawyer, and a backup lawyer from, um, uh, a backup advocate, an independent advocate from Brazil, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,
