
Okay. Here I just This is what you know I just had a drink
0:05
like this. This is this just chocolate but
0:11
it's not chocolate. It's like a sorry it's creativity
0:17
but you know I just keep this out but it's still like um boiling. So it's like kind of one solution we have in Nigeria
0:22
you know but you know this is just normal standard solution. It doesn't mean it's hard it just means you have to
0:28
solve the problem. If it's a hard problem, use hard solutions. Look, you don't need a hard solution to solve hard problem. Look, basically this why it
0:34
matters. But look example, literally Mara, I love I love this kind of
0:40
solution. Look, it doesn't matter what this is. This is a bowl. Call this a bone marrow. It's a big bomb, but it's
0:46
liquid in it. Look at water. Yeah, it's water, but it's what? Chocolate. It's chocolate mar. It's chocolate, but it's
0:53
chocolate. And um look, got this thing here. But Use it for other things. Use it to
0:59
wash it. Use it to wash plates. Look, it doesn't matter. You know, if you can put something in it, you know, you can wash
1:04
that thing. That's what sink really is. It's like a means of communication cuz you know, pro. It doesn't matter what it
1:11
is. We can solve your problem. That's how we do it in Nigeria. And that's why I'm making it like this. If I don't, if
1:16
I don't solve this problem properly, you know, all of going to die computationally. Look, this is like a a
1:21
bowl. A bowl is for something use. You can use it for anything for like a cooking, to cleaning, for you know. So
1:28
you can put some good long as the B can hold it contain it saying for example doesn't matter what it says if it can
1:33
contain it properly whether it's water or food well you can use it for that you know that's what I'm saying it doesn't
1:39
have to be a means of bureaucracy like talking that's what matters look this is a proof of mirror this I'm cooking look
1:45
what I'm saying you can cook with this part look but this bowl is contains um what hot chocolate hot chocolate yes hot
1:51
chocolate and what porridge and what kind of kind of type of porridge this is
1:57
a Oh, the same thing for food. You can't even smash this bowl. So, this B protected three to cook and clean and
2:04
stuff like that. It doesn't matter. This book can be for three things. It doesn't matter. We do that in Nigeria, you know, cuz what? You share it. You share it.
2:10
And it's not enough, guys. Look, I'm cooking here, you know. Put a little here. But this is like useless to me.
2:17
But I'm putting it dry here. But it's clean cuz it get burnt. It doesn't get burnt. No, cuz I'm using it. If this get
2:23
burnt, I'll still make another one. And that's what we do. We'll make our own things you know this doesn't work for me so this looks all kind of interesting to
2:30
you basically I made a water fountain most of like there Niger but I made a water design and so it the same thing
2:36
happens to me basically I had some found here same example I put this fountain into some liquid and I put that straw
2:43
straw under this thing you know cuz we have to do it we have to do it you know it doesn't matter it's a breakthrough or
2:49
no we have to do it no matter how dangerous it is you know someone has to clean gas pipes we don't want to do
2:55
clean gas pipes or the oil tank you know oil tanks yes someone no one you doesn't
3:01
matter who cleans you know someone has to do it when you're doing the job when it's a trade that's the kind of thing I hate they have useful but use
3:08
incorrectly you know it's already there I use incorrectly all of everything there you know everything and nothing
3:14
you know that's what the program this kind of egg is [ __ ] I can if it's not mine what I steal it I steal what I
3:22
stuff you know we get This my what I was drinking my
3:28
I just came back here. I didn't know I had it here.
3:37
Okay. So, uh my policy proation anything
3:42
uh as a policy proving policy protocols are not means of communication. They're means of everything and anything uh
3:49
someone says or anything that that can mean something um explaining me something. We have tomographic
3:55
implications of policy. So that means we have a demographic um
4:00
uh demographic policy system. Uh that must mean everything um is uh
4:07
everything's interdependent uh interdependency um A to B you between A and B. So nothing is um uh depend
4:15
um basically the hierarchy um you know this is like um everything
4:20
was in tomographic resolution the final principle um keep quiet
4:28
man keep uh so basically um so basically the
4:36
tri police is like literally um let me think
4:43
record anything cuz I forgot. Anyway, let me start recording.
4:50
No, I want to forget that now. I don't care. He's shouting me now.
4:57
I don't give a [ __ ] He's shouting for now. Okay.
5:02
I don't understand him nothing. I don't give a [ __ ] If I understand him, I don't want to give [ __ ] I don't want to
5:07
understand him enough. I don't care if you understand in my life cuz I understand calculus you understand
5:14
calculus you know I go tell me you know
5:35
what I mean what do I mean baba baba No, I don't know. [ __ ]
5:41
I be dad though.
5:48
It's the most wonderful time.
6:06
It doesn't matter what it says, you know, as long as a knife, it doesn't matter if it's a blade, a weapon. It doesn't matter what it takes. As long as
6:12
get the job done. That's what I'm saying. That's how we do Nigeria. I think it gets the job done. Doesn't
6:17
matter if a cop or not. It just matters. We get ourselves sorted. You know, that's what's always been,
6:23
you know, if you go back to the ancient days on ocean text or ocean Hebrew text, Hebrew text, you know, that's where
6:29
Afric not evil not like Egypt is banned cuz when we write things down it's like that we don't it's been text we wrote it
6:37
it's not God like we like Abraham like all of damn things
6:43
we write it down it works you know it works because um it's already been in our Hebrew text from our Hebrew origin
6:50
from our side of the story that's what I'm saying it works for us cuz you know we wrote it you know it doesn't work the
6:56
other way around I'm saying So the kind of thing I'm saying is that
7:03
when sit down Mara I'm going to like go I'm talking to you manifest I love I love talking to women I blonde doesn't
7:09
matter who it is I love blond is the best but but it doesn't mean
7:16
suff F. I kind of just like a
7:27
I know what he looks like, but I don't remember a lot. I know what it looks like, but I don't know what what it
7:32
means anymore. I don't know what it means. So, that's going to have problem cuz my mom had a Hebrew Bible. Sorry. I
7:39
don't know Hebrew book and Hebrew bookish. One was Jewish and Heb. So, basically my uh
7:46
system. So basically the foundation of the people um this man um
7:54
this is the if you want to call me I'm all right I don't really care oh Mar you can call me but other people can call me too obmplic
8:04
policies only uh there's principle so is like a if everything this is principle here so
8:10
implicit policy everything is implicit uh because I don't like policies policies uh no static crosses only have
8:16
implicit everything implicit uh means that you know you um declare it ahead of time. Uh but you
8:23
know you have to define what you want to declare. So it's kind of just types definition. So you hold um the space and
8:29
time definition until it uh resolves itself. It doesn't rotate flip itself. It just it just has to be works for
8:36
everyone. It's trident. It works in um axis. So it works in alignment. Uh so example this one rift alignment. It's
8:42
called alignment. I call it a rift alignment. uh cuz like a gate line for
8:48
example uh stage this is that we start at a stage so we already got a contract um uh zed um 0001 this graphically e is
8:55
epsilon so this is a stage this and epilon but they don't resolve at so this z or z this a par but this e means
9:02
epsilon so this is um the one we all share if something works across all the mediums we share it and that's epsilon
9:09
stage um is this record I don't know yes uh if epsilon Es and you if I have E
9:16
for you have negative E I have negative E you have E that's mean epsilon state
9:21
and then E E we have one one so this we share this E we negative positive so you
9:27
have a minus ZZ because you know that's basically the Z ais so X is um so
9:32
basically you have to test them we tested which is basically it's imported
9:38
um implicitly but you you have a specific policy defined end of time you have this baked roofs because you have
9:45
bas
9:53
uh for example so I'm to the phone right now guys I'm
9:58
the this is in secret protocol here and look basically this is the macros this is this rifile but this is standard
10:04
refile uh this ri file but this ri file is for what uh uh riff um this ri a
10:10
macro macro but this is a macro for all languages it doesn't matter what language you lose you define what macros
10:16
here but the macros are universal. Basically this macro is only for rift uh digital um downloaders uh like no no non
10:24
digital or just like a physical download USB sticks. Uh so basically you can download rift with the rift any file
10:31
star the rift but you can have a name of a file as a policy that maps to all the wall copers you have met you have an
10:37
implicit uh rift file. So this is a a rift file R file R file this rift file
10:42
but this not the Rift file. So this is a this one file. Now this rift t now this
10:48
is system level configuration um or platform level configure doesn't matter your windows back level but you don't
10:53
know if the if the if the target ripple is python and you run a python this system what run is python anything that
11:00
runs okay if a system rift is a equivalent so this is the master switch
11:06
yeah so this is the master switch for one ecosystem it can be python it's really python but this is something
11:12
because rift is really rift c This this is a C but it's a master switch. Oh, it
11:17
mean sorry Mara. Basically this is a membrane. The membrane just means what? Uh the the the
11:24
brain process information. So basically it means like um the the accidentally been doing the job. Uh a memory. So it's
11:31
a memory brain but it's a branch. So it's like it's like it's like a branch but not a node because basically it's a
11:37
main brain. It's not it's actually do the job. It's an edge but
11:42
it's an edge of a brain system. So it's a system that um expect itself so you can grow brushes grow more nodes um this
11:49
like um no no context assumed basically this is defl
11:57
that's basically this syntax here is python that's why it's python native so this is python this is this if you want
12:04
to run this you can write some rift uh py you can stand what's name for python
12:15
This is this is the most reolution lexical syntactical because this is Python or Python terminal. You are using
12:22
Python syntax. So this is a membrane in brackets in right angle brackets and this is coherence treasure.
12:30
This is not good enough. This like what the main target is the main function target
12:36
and one that's not flo. So this like this like this this kindical implicit of
12:41
what uh a type think of it like a a big number uh zero or one uh but the big
12:46
number between zero and one is arbitrary because um zero or one when you hold one
12:51
thing you hold the whole thing but that whole thing can be category so it can be like a 10 10 set of class 10 instances
12:58
in memory and 10 instead of something cluster but if that's one cluster that's also one one one system one system you
13:06
run natively uh plus one to 10 uh somewhere between one between um uh some 10 classes on one system. So 10 classes
13:14
um that that run uh that def object interact with some interface as um just
13:19
object objects define ahead of time. So the problem here
13:25
again I have to get up now. Sorry guys. So basically this kind of files here are the mandatory files where
13:32
it doesn't
13:40
Sorry.
14:00
The problem is
14:05
So this is a tommo file. This just python this is a lower package. This be a lower
14:11
rock file. This will be a lu lower rocks file or end package json or package j or
14:17
the native one for like um a deno I don't know f basically
14:24
the canle default for all the systems. It doesn't matter as npm this just tumbl example but you can write in tumbl
14:31
python because it's just a py basically this is just written c
14:36
doesn't have a standard packaging system that's why mum I can package this any how I want to package it target platform
14:42
that's why it matters you get what I'm saying so it's going to be um no don't assume anything mode false basically um
14:50
detach mode is like um default rotation n so n means no type no value no pointer just just a n pointer context. No,
14:57
doesn't hold it. Just holds um it's like a yield. You get a void pointer which comes to null but doesn't hold null
15:04
memory or no this no type of only hold state. Uh so it's still so very
15:09
important
15:16
is exactly two. So basically it doesn't
15:25
this what I'm saying. You got to stand here. Oh, this has to stay. Let me just um
15:31
times when it crosses a line and when it doesn't cross a line and I could actually
15:49
See what I'm saying? See, I can't see either. So, basically,
15:54
let me read out to you. This is my work. This is like the still definition.
16:00
Basically, it holds no context, no nothing for all the systems. So, it works like that. So, uh still
16:07
just means uh you have to all have two branches of access. So, it's still
16:12
because it's um actively active. It does it knows what it's doing. It's not active actively advocates. It's an
16:18
active system and it's sparse. It's sparse. It's basically active as sparse or sparse. That means um can be modern
16:25
anyhow. So it observes and consumes. It does and does job. It observes and adapt. It's not every time it does
16:32
something observe it state and that's what's called an active system. It's no passive like a keyboard actually knows
16:37
what it's doing when you type on it. It's active uh um active program. They can branch out. Basically branches out
16:44
to more people. That's the idea. It doesn't matter whe you're in Korea or Japan and you need food, you are your
16:49
water shelter just branches out because it's still so it's still it holds in memory.
16:55
So basically so it's stateless that means um it's stateless that means active and it's
17:00
still that means it state is um it doesn't have a state at home. It just it just keeps um growing because it doesn't
17:06
need to exist. It's just part of the M uh meta file. So with that in mind it's
17:13
already exe. So you have two branches um two main seeds you can do because everything has to be secure. So it's two
17:18
seeds two kind of topic tomography systems. So you can define this how you define P. So you can grow up because you
17:24
know of two things only uh because you have to secure for itself you have to grow on itself and that's what OB is.
17:30
Um, oh, basically, um, oh, what
32:00
my basically I'm saying this is like language but this like the language
32:05
I could count it's going to be there forever so it's so
32:11
um good so how many I'm going to do mathematically uh so I'm going to shuffle it uh one two
32:19
uh so we got one two three four five six seven eight Okay, I get uh this one. Uh
32:26
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
32:31
Uh that'll be fine. So that'll be fine. So this
32:40
so get um so Oh, I see. So you're fine. Fine. Thank you. SB. So if I see when I
32:47
see a B, I put an S. When I see
32:56
Sex. Oh, sex. Sex here. Oh, I love sex. I love sex.
33:03
Yes, I do. I do care. I don't care.
33:11
Children, you know, I can't have anything. So, I can't really do
33:17
this.
33:32
So far so the trident is here and yeah so basically is like a forming but you got
33:39
axis you get like a two axis so OB and X is on the X axis and the Y axis but they are opposite to polar opposite so you
33:46
can so if I go where east so it's a problem give you move east. So
33:54
basically there's four PS we don't know anything that makes sense to you on this accent but you don't know it but there
34:01
are four PS so norththeast
34:06
norththeast uh south uh west
34:12
southwest so so uh so do it quickly do it
34:18
sorry this is a x
34:23
X. Oh, this used to fill up. X
34:30
fill up.
34:39
This annoy me guys.
34:54
I love being here, man. Oh, so this is N. No, no. N E X X N
35:03
I B O X.
35:10
Oh, that will be X. Thanks
35:20
for uh uh the um
35:40
T okay
35:52
now zero. N E O B I
35:59
So properly sorry.
36:04
So basically find uh something. So this like the letters this words but these
36:09
are words and access. So how the rule works firstly I want to say oh hot heart
36:15
or soul or d3 this is obi because your name is you can spell your name you know
36:20
because sex there but you know if your name is sex you know I'm like um kind of
36:26
um so you we use system so what I want to say uh I want to say hot you know hot
36:33
and you hot uh so this protocol this how it works mathematically speaking
36:43
Uh so it works like this. So get um heart work through like this three access. So the word is heart uh
36:50
basically it's meant to solve visually uh you can express yourself language you can see you can see anything how any how
36:55
you want to say it but you know you have to be granted uh chemical dignity. So
37:00
you know respecting people. So OBI you can say OBI as
37:05
in one poll we get OBI. Okay, this appro.
37:12
So that's OBI OB that's the one XIS that get OBI to get one XIS X1 that's OBI
37:20
that's X north X so get north get east is um east one going east so going north
37:28
one going north so you get X O north so look at north X=
37:36
north X north Y
37:41
or 2 or two north uh or uh uh or polar opposites. Polar opposites you can say
37:48
up and down x or xy x to y
37:54
to x no um the word um square
38:00
we get uh east. So let me model those graphs. You get the one going uh um O. So you get um uh
38:07
I'm trying the one to get the edges predetermined because we already know the edges based on how you write words.
38:12
So these are the letters word here. The length of the word is like but you have to shuffle it. Um the basically you can have you say one things many things at
38:18
many times. So you have to get information still shuffle is very important. So you have two inputs for two inputs you have one and that's just
38:25
a default for for more than what you say there's two outputs to one input.
38:30
because you know you can have you can anyhow but if you comp anyhow it's not sparse and that's what I'm saying it's not actually sparse. So uh how you get
38:37
um I'm thinking so basically can you look at this word and find out the word obi. Uh so obi backwards we get one two
38:45
three and that's from index. So uh that's going what? North.
38:50
So that's going east. So so this is east one east one uh east square because you get the be. So that be uh cisco uh left
38:58
root right. That's left root right. And that's the chemical stand. So this is
39:03
left right. This will be your oh this is my one but this is your one this is a Cisco one uh Cisco but this is a call
39:09
interface um basically the core uh program it's like um if I send this information now you know what I would
39:15
whatever able to get it so if I send in OB would I need to still send um I like a
39:23
OB that would be the heart point to this data b
39:29
get corrupt can I still read it that's why it's access it's like on the fly send it If I send letters letters O B I
39:35
which are um the the segment information which is three information you know can I still send I if I send B I B I can I
39:44
still send what uh B I can I still send um B I can I still send O and still get
39:49
information OB can I if I send um I O can I still send what uh uh B that's
39:54
what means you know getting information the whole data set data packet so try
40:01
the models that's the It's like a spring. The spring when you push a spring, it springs back to you.
40:07
It's like, you know, when you have a spring, you have a spring, it pushes back to you. That's what I do to get OBI
40:13
uh OBI that would be um here and OB. Can I do an X over here?
40:22
OBI is here. You get it here too. So, this my pro OB.
40:30
So basically I already found three obis in the word of when you graph them as an x ais and y axis. So you get three obs.
40:39
So you have three obs uh in um backwards um so which do I take to get to you to a
40:45
female. So if I want to see your mind right I see what you're saying understand what you mean as a woman I have to go where uh east east I have to
40:52
go east squ. So that mean my area I cover is east squ. So I have to use all of east square. be what? Pi over uh the
40:59
pi 3.4 for the radius. Uh the radius being the packet information, the radius
41:04
of the data. Uh the radius being halfway basically 0.5 from the center the radius
41:10
and that pi r² and and 2 pi r over what
41:15
pi r 180 and 2 pi r because that's the path the 2 pi r is the path of data. So the
41:23
length of the data is um y= the path. So you have the so the radius of the data
41:29
is what r² you know r* r. So you have the r* r which is divided by r. So you
41:34
have to like this will be medium. So the medium is a median the mean is a r squ
41:41
uh divid by r be the mean uh 0.5 okay 5 *.5
41:50
uh b this is length of the uh *.5
41:57
*.5 * 1 / r
42:05
/ Five. This will be uh two two. So you take the length of this one is two. Uh
42:11
but this is the full length of it. This was auxil path. But you take two um two
42:17
edges. So you have to two walks. Two walks. So these are what are called walks. for this walk where you take for
42:24
the hamiltonian and um it doesn't matter uh the the whether you use a top down para or like a bottom up par
42:31
uh where if you go to right you start passing from right root to left uh or you don't matter whe to go on breath
42:37
search or defe is not the Q is bre and the def is um a
42:43
stack so that's what you use to pass the system um same so the thing I'm saying
42:49
is like it matters here. Now I'm recording this. Yes, I'm putting
42:54
this. So uh so you get this uh position here.
43:04
I love you. So basically if I send information now
43:10
uh I hit send you know uh I can send send in real timely. I can type it while sending and this will be on auxiliary
43:17
work. I just keep construction there's more space I need time I need. I will hold that memory until it's it doesn't
43:23
break down. It shouldn't break down. So you can sp
43:30
of three but you know have to length. So this be 3 * 3 * 2 and that would be 3
43:40
* 2 that be uh 2 * 2 this two r 2 * 2 *
43:46
2 3 * 2 uh 2 * 2 will be six and 6 * 2 is 18 oh you got wrong I know 18 but
43:55
this will be 18 uh megabytes of data you storage uh because you get three seconds
44:01
you get three letters um 18 bytes bits. So you get three segments. So three segments uh sending what? Um three
44:09
bytes. Three bytes three by time three uh between OBI OB. Yes. Yes. Yes. So you
44:15
get all the information once that's basically you then have to push this to the same force. If you get information
44:20
there you have to go you have to double the force. So you know so if you send this information you have to make sure you have the message package ready. So
44:26
this be three um this will be um so if you send example if you send um pi r 2 pi r that would be pi. So this will be
44:33
uh so if you're working on the tomography layer you have to pi which is no problem. So pi so I already said uh
44:40
you need 18 bytes of memory uh which is 3 * 6 or 6 of memory allocated
44:46
pre-allocate to get it but you don't need that you just need to do actively so can have it while you need it uh when
44:51
you don't need it. So you get 3 * 6 uh 3 * 6 is 18 18 * pi. So let me just
45:00
get pi symbol pi pi and that'll be um 56
45:08
uh 66 + 54 866. So basically this what you
45:14
share between pi r. So the polar part is two basically this is divided by 18
45:20
divided by 180 because 180 means the things getting good
45:25
system. So that's 180° uh 180° uh 180 that will be um that will
45:32
be 0.314° of turning you have to do um you have to
45:37
turn that u to get to that point um to get this seed one seat. So you turn
45:43
here, you turn to this exit, this really this before you send this message, you this is a seat as a polish. You get
45:49
0.3145 there's a turning radius on what one east going just facing east. Now if you
45:56
go uh east squared you have to go um you haven't moved just turned uh you just
46:02
facing what east to woman's side um facto
46:08
bottom first search pass and then to go up go a b i
46:15
so bically you have three ways to do this to get bi so basically um if I get um so I'm sending b i so b if I send b
46:23
left root b I telling a lot uh I I really if I get if I'm sending B I O if
46:30
I go B I O past B I O and I mean OBI actually get
46:36
something mean of it and that's why the person bio doesn't mean bio doesn't mean
46:41
um a bio doesn't mean what OB so bio means I don't know what that one means
46:46
bio so if I get two B if I press B I should get what uh left root O if I
46:52
press B I should press next O I should know I'm pressing and I don't know I'm pressing I should get O because you know
46:59
that mean active you know can I can either get B O or B I know I'm pressing B but you know
47:07
can get everything else but this as well but simply if I get B I press O I should get O then I easily that's the same uh
47:15
that's a root but that root O I so that O I easily because there's nothing else
47:20
to it so that's what it matters so if I press an I should get an O B if I or B
47:26
if I press a B uh it's a six he know
47:32
what they're doing. Oh 43 minutes. So basically 0.1345 is one C access of of
47:38
walking just walking edge bound trident edge um can use to get it. Um so try
47:44
data edge for all edges. Um that's what she turn
47:51
for one part and get pi r².
47:56
So we get pip r
48:09
* 2 no r is 18 2 * 2 is four
48:20
wait the medium's art which two. Okay. 2 * 3
48:30
* 2 is 9. Uh, wait. So, you get two plus two.
48:37
So, half plus a half. Half times a half.
48:42
Oh, so I don't think radius is.5. I can't
48:48
think. So, we get
48:54
half of What if I do two half plus a half
49:01
half plus a half half plus a half uh divided by rid
49:09
by um five is two. So 1 divided by um.5 is 2 * what
49:16
uh time uh * 3 which is six
49:24
2 and six. Yes. Six is the the r 2 no um
49:30
no um divided by what? No. Okay. 6^ 2
49:36
is what? 0.166 times what? Time pi * 3.14
49:45
that is 0.5 235 97755
49:51
98 295 0.5 this turn wall. So this this
49:57
will be going this is my this is my epsilon this will be going. So this will be 0.52359877
50:05
and this one computed in my head as well. So 3.523 59 5987
50:14
and this will be the unit I have to start walking east uh business to get the data sent that's what matters. So
50:20
basically the co system epil
50:29
so e of growth the growth that's a grow if it's two if you get two e
50:36
is the ratio of growth is.147 and that's model. So it doesn't matter whether the system fails or not uh fails
50:43
one person that's not usually grows with us. So you get um the the the the literal number 2.71
50:50
is just 78. Let's try them two um 2 78 is just a different decimal places you
50:56
use but you have get you get 666. So get um that's the model
51:01
of growth um and then pi is the magic unit um for signal processing. Where's my calculator?
51:08
Pi will be what? Pi pi will be 3.141
51:14
uh that's use of pi for it was pi r squ no magic number I can't get magic
51:20
numbers here uh but that'll be minus i * i think guys
51:27
for the area thank you guys
