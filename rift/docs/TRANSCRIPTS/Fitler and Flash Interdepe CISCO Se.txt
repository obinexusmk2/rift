Let me get my life.
1:20
Okay, let's just start. Oh, started. Okay, so now it started. So, let's Okay,
1:25
the time now is 1 minute 20 [ __ ]
1:37
black. So the title of this video chalk the title is
1:45
I go 43 minutes timer on it. Oh it's not recording. Yep. It's now recording. Yep. Is it
1:53
guys? Uh the white is going on. Okay. Fresh. Um yeah go to title
2:00
original here. Title is sent to me sent to me plan.
2:07
filter flash interdependency uh sequence and series Cisco order
2:14
here. Oh no, I'm busy. I'm busy. I'm busy. I'm streaming. I'm streaming. Well, you're not going to come. I know
2:20
you're not listen. I'm sorry, but I cannot
2:29
just go sequence [snorts] and see this.
2:36
Execution order inverse
2:42
relay messages
2:48
try okay
2:53
to type ready I can't see myself anymore now I can see myself uh yeah so try to
2:59
do flash is
3:05
I don't know.
3:10
So uh filter
3:22
flash
3:36
dependence. What's up?
3:48
Um,
3:59
vertically
4:04
here. here.
4:13
done. So there
4:19
uh let's see once you receive the so basically the title guys here
4:28
the title is filter and flash interdependent um inter interdependent
4:34
Cisco uh Cisco sequence and series instruction uh instruction execution
4:40
order uh VR inverse relay u try messages
4:45
Um yeah so a brief the brief a brief desription of the title
4:51
the title is about so what we're getting into is quite complex but it's basically statements
4:58
for human rights oper system um but today's date is um the 13th of January
5:03
26 the time now is 10:15 a.m. Um the goal of this have a conscious message
5:08
packet. So um you can think of this as a chamber of echo chamber uh something
5:15
echoser echo chamber not echos server it's basically try and read message system
5:21
for the beauty ination in computer so it's basically filter flash sequence
5:29
into the sequence so something for inmemoration so it's um it's
5:38
independent because it's supposed to filter and flash of filtering and flashing. uh filtering
5:45
uh ref idea of sodium uh sodium but it's basically a type of
5:52
function function funers of functions functors which is a mo functions um
6:01
filters filtering sorting searching merge sort all the search all all the algorith does
6:08
not destroy anything. We just mutate the data. It's not destroy have state
6:15
pure functions um that are functions that just mutate the uh um uh mutate the
6:22
state but not the data. Mut data but not the state of the system. Um you know you
6:28
don't for example splice splice and splice. Uh splice is um splice is like a
6:35
a computation function like you're splicing your you're trimming [clears throat] out data moving like
6:40
some kind of index your prun you're not mutating the data you're not you're not
6:46
mutating the state of the program or said you're mutating just the data you're working on the data so we just
6:52
have to get information without the state of the program and that's what I'm saying it doesn't um it's a filter we
6:58
need a slice uh as a slice. But the slice means you're taking all the programs and um uh
7:05
even all the data like uh for example here I'm going to write this example here. So uh before I start I'm going to
7:12
use my business name um um OBS. Um so I'm going to have an axis here to
7:18
determine ahead of time what I'm talking about. So it's basically example I give you if I give the word my business name
7:24
OB nexus
7:30
this is one axis uh I can choose um I can search for index uh uh this
7:36
[clears throat] is x axis uh xaxis it's basically um xaxis um I think I made a
7:44
mistake uh x and uh uh x X X here
7:52
goes this way. Y goes this way. So uh what uh xx2
8:04
and this same message here will be nexus is my um
8:11
yeah they have two axis of so it's basically the term distance is bally hot
8:17
and soul uh model but the filtering is like a sodium
8:23
search merging without changing Chrome state and flashing is the actual storage of the data. Um the quality the problem
8:31
here is uh all for E for Bravo, I for indigo,
8:37
Nvember, E for echo, X for X-ray, E for etc. have two axis X for Y. But they
8:45
have three accesses message have three axises X Y and Z. But this message is a
8:51
trident. It's a trident message because the world is threedimensional.
8:56
So the interpretation must be served threedimension. It's called a trident message back. You know because the world
9:02
has three dimensions. We have X Y and Z. And this protocol shows that message go
9:08
through the X Y and Z and preserves the message. So the work on polar inverse
9:15
two. So the preserve the data structure. So the work as you can see in the board has future fashion dependency. Uh so
9:24
fing dependency is the idea that they work on polar my model of lapis
9:29
integration. So which I put back. Lapis equation basically a lapis is a
9:35
polar polar system but the work on
9:40
the work on pi on p
9:46
um the work pie west
9:53
high is west high is west pi4
9:59
is North. Oh, sorry.
10:05
So, pi north, east, southwest. So, we get pi / 4 is north. Pi over 3 is east.
10:15
East and pi over pi over two is going to be south
10:26
and pi over pi. This part
10:31
is so west. So as you can see you have uh polarity lapis L for normal E for
10:39
apple P for copper I for in S for SA it stands for it's my calculus intuition my
10:47
calculus I used to um code polar systems so they work on the kind of system of
10:53
dependency too. So you know it's work 0 0 but the 0 0 is basically um referring
11:01
to the the um kind of um um you get turn
11:07
you have an angle you determine the angle you want to move first before you u go which is obvious to the x and y. So
11:15
you have an angle theta and that angle is theta. Theta is the angle and theta
11:22
is defined by the angle you want to move first and that the direction you want to go. So theta of rotation and power the
11:31
power use. So can be just lambda you get
11:36
lambda lambda calculus and calculus you use them in kind of power what power
11:42
what power want to use and the power use for power power equals 1 / something
11:49
else or lambda power and distribution but
11:54
they work together to send a message um via trident the tr system three
12:02
messages three um three um three messages that sent together for the work
12:07
spring. So I come on but this so you know let's just
12:13
[laughter] here you know the message how you get you get O
12:20
you get BB you get um 2B um Z so how do
12:26
you see this like an axis of letters I told you how I did it uh so it's
12:31
basically uh BB O so B B so you have the
12:37
packet BB here two B's when you're doing the two Bs
12:43
here on the B on the axis X B and B and B you know B and B which if I send
12:52
one message if I send one send one B in two systems there's a there's aation
12:58
there's a chemical shared there two B's the two B's are
13:04
you see So, and the two beats are basically
13:54
Thank you.
14:13
Okay. Okay. Um,
14:19
calculus trigonometry. So, one second, guys.
14:24
trigger memory look up click up table.
14:30
Uh uh so
14:42
yes. So basically uh video coding science
14:53
video I'm saying to you one second.
15:04
So insane. So we're going to continue the video but literally it's not 030
15:13
truth table 0 30 uh uh square to half square to 3 pi
15:21
and you know
15:27
so simple trick table so let me just go to trick table here
15:33
six radian motor so it's modifying.
15:44
Okay, one second, guys. I'm going to have to do this the hard way, I think. So, so you know, I need to find
15:52
Yeah. Okay. uh currently I'm still currently currently need to find uh uh
16:00
uh memory memory pneumonics table for um
16:05
uh integration for uh for before I continue for trigonometry
16:12
I need a list image that shows me in a table.
16:21
So, so
16:31
how the how how the how the integration
16:37
how the differentiation works. Okay. So, let's continue.
16:46
So we got this bas where we left off on stairs. So where we
16:53
left off was stairs [gasps]
16:58
basically so to right angle opposite
17:08
two. Okay. basically close creat
17:19
but litally get um 2. So P and B you get
17:25
B and I or I and B and I get I here
17:32
and you get see let's get VB V R
17:38
and uh So R
17:48
get I get excit
18:07
just depends on the code access um the way it observe the message from so you
18:12
get how you are okay so let me see the code that table
18:20
yeah [gasps]
18:29
okay so close finish this table um so
18:34
like I was saying to you um the video is um to continue. So we
18:42
get the message OBS from two angles two axises uh two axis.
18:48
So you get the x ais or be r x you get a y axis and you get a z ais ais um but
18:56
this bally axis the z uh which is basically um the uh uh the tangent line
19:05
uh the tangent line but z is not tangent line it's basically um the um
19:14
the mathem wonderful way to divide the x axis or not. You get the projection of the uh x and y axis.
19:22
Let me just read the message first. So the message will be
19:29
nexus but you know depending on how you look at the message. So, uh, a bit of a
19:34
redundancy. You got BN BN. Oh, this is the first two lines of
19:41
it. BN uh uh B uh E
19:47
B S uh B U and B S.
19:53
But our goal is to send this message. Uh so we draw the first two lines which is
19:59
indexis and uh uh the first ais x0 x index zero the z index on the x0
20:12
x for this here. So here and now
20:21
here
20:30
it's like the the as you can see as you can see
20:35
guys the message is here already
20:41
you can form the message up so it's basically uh over graph so the first
20:47
index of X axis you just have two X axis um X and Y you
20:53
get you get four [clears throat] combinations you get X which is like um
20:58
two X now you get uh X Y for the Y ais you get YX
21:06
and you get Y um so the the term the term uh se
21:14
sequence represents the sequence of communication So you got xx xy yx and y y y y y y y y
21:22
y y y y y y y y y y y y y these are three axises three axis to have comput. So if you comput the y ais you use x and
21:28
x mathematically of course you can use it but to get to the yaxis
21:33
of y have uh sequences sequences and series of instructions [clears throat]
21:39
um message say what I'm doing so the sequences
21:45
request double the message um trouble try to one message two messages to one
21:52
or interpretation of the system uh like ox can represented as next OB where next
21:59
OB will be backward. The word OB for V for bra
22:07
for echo X for X-ray for S can be S for sugar formula X for Xray E for echo for
22:16
E for bra for Oscar. Yeah. Can be that way too. You just have to um depending on the kind of how set that you are
22:24
inter way Cisco this is the standard way you send stuff you have
22:32
citizen
22:41
it's a standard way solution video works basically uh it's basically the chemical way everything every legend yeah get
22:48
there's no garb um you can stop ging by using Cisco. So
22:53
the Cisco represents the system of um self balancing trees you have on the
22:58
left and right. So I'm going to this book one more time and give you I'm
23:04
going to using this uh place here. So 1 2 3 4 I'm going to use this area here.
23:09
So I will show you what Cisco is doing after I do this complet but um so now
23:15
the three. So, so the term obus is hard can be can be said as uh sex sex
23:24
sus sex next ebo ebo success word flip order and
23:34
you could say obis but are do you mean obelis or no? So an x to y sequence uh x
23:44
to y sequence you know x inverse y so x
23:49
inverse x sequence because you give a two direction flow and you know it's
23:55
basically what I'm
24:00
bottom up so this I'm going to discuss here but let me finish with this so the message
24:07
can Again bottom up which is like started from um
24:14
the S to the O uh top down from the O as root to the S but respecting left root
24:21
right left I mean root left right uh root root
24:28
being the O being the root B being the the left and the I being the right and
24:33
um and so on you have a balanced um uh uh red black tree that doesn't black
24:40
tree doesn't need to be pruned. Um you go I'm going to prune anything it's can't produce for example um the message
24:49
of October I for India is Octo be India it can be can be
24:56
represented as two different ways so two different colors now it's kind of
25:03
kind of funny so you know so you get I I you get N when you get I N you get two
25:12
orders you have back and forth. You get an I. Um but depending on the order of the system, you get an I. You get I get
25:20
E. You get I get E
25:26
and then you get this. Then you get
25:34
uh uh odd odd
25:39
then x then you get odd
25:44
then you then you get
25:50
odd. So get vectors you get
25:57
the board. In the first set to get two B's um BB BB I I you're trying to reduce
26:05
the system to a state where there's no ambiguity in the message. So over the
26:10
x-axis y axis the the losses x so you get two axis of messages you use the
26:16
loss of varation but l just know that's how works so the work access and the
26:21
last so you have three axis here xxy yx the last y can be used for rotation
26:31
um if the message is is a y axis sent in the the x the y axis of the world or
26:38
something the the the the x-axis is already in there. So you can use you
26:43
just use the one axis to verify the message. But the trident is the trident is basically XY X to Y2X and Y to Y.
26:51
That's the message. That's the full message. Um so for any verification the stick works on one axis only and that's
26:57
the X axis check the the share the X notion. It's just the message just to
27:05
message. So the X the X sequence is basically um double the memory and half
27:10
the time. That's the sequence of C double the memory and half the time a try me. So the memory is basically
27:17
double the memory and half the time. Okay. So that be half the time and triple the message. So the message
27:25
so let me finish the board now. So you get um uh NP
27:32
NP you get uh N I
27:38
you get N you get N E you get N X you get N U or U
27:53
N depending on how a reflection I'm sorry.
28:01
So this is a full board here. Let move closer to see how it looks like.
28:07
So here computer work sometime. So the here now protocol is OBI Nexus. See how
28:12
you get X here X is just for vacation but it contains you can't have you can't
28:18
have a Yaxis. You cannot have a Yaxis without an X-axis you know. So y can be
28:23
computed as um mathematically y can be computed from x we need two x-axis and
28:29
how that will be is uh via polar sequences. So for example you have uh xx
28:35
uh xx really two axis of x negative x and positive x uh and therefore you can
28:41
have one y axis y axis because you know um you can have for example if you have
28:46
so toa y x you have cosine cosine the cosine is basically the x equivalent of
28:53
theta the x of theta um cosine u um uh
28:59
30° equals um uh something. So let me
29:04
try to give a copy and do it perfectly. So as you can see this axis of OBS has
29:11
no my pen broken too.
29:17
So this axis one second guys
29:23
broke my choke broke. So [clears throat]
29:28
you have the axis of XYZ
29:34
and the mathematical because they are interdependent
29:39
by design interdependent by design. Uh you can have intermissions which are a
29:45
sequence of instructions can run while the system control command system by me
29:52
as a so it's a command system on the fly. So they share some kind of lapis
29:57
integration over polar work. So as you can see here we have pi / 4. Pi / 4 is
30:04
equivalent to uh a system of pi / 4. uh P4 is no east is P3 but you get a system
30:12
that's interdependent that you can you can run can that can be executed on the fly because you know it's so g
30:24
messages messages that mean something via three interpretations in one system for consensus yes no and
30:32
maybe so you can see here you have pi 4 pi / 3 which is east, pi over uh two
30:40
which is south and pi over pi which is west. The sun rises in the east and sets
30:46
in the west. The sun rises in the east and set in the west. So you can use your your hands to do this mathematically
30:51
verify too. Now the second protocol is November I indicate
31:02
to verify ahead of time. Uh so it's not
31:07
It's not a bureaucratic system can actually do something uh via command
31:13
commanding and controlling. So you get the um uh sigi uh symbolic expression
31:18
files uh expression of intent symbolic intent files those can run
31:25
command and control and just send me. So the messages are protocol buffers
31:33
and they work on protocol because they are they have can have a standardized
31:38
schisma and the schema is supposed to verify not the message. So this maps the
31:44
schema too because message can be tampered with but not the schema. This is called standard work. Then you get
31:51
the same problem you have with someone using your system via ruling. But the
31:56
yes no concerns yes no maybe problem is what is based on because you can have my
32:02
yes be your no. Your no be my yes. And we can go agree on maybe maybe we can
32:08
say maybe and what maybe means you know show maybe.
32:14
We can say yes. If I know yes that mean yes my my head not a yes my shake head
32:19
shake is a no but also maybe it's a struggle the shoulder maybe maybe or
32:25
lifted the hand and you know that's why the system matters because this is needed for parties to negotiate in terms
32:31
of the system um uh so as you can see here guys uh the let me just read it out
32:38
you know xx xxx ais x ais y axis so as
32:44
you The x2 exercises have the same yaxis depending on the message
32:49
but the construction is independent. So you don't need the yaxis it's not needed you don't need the y axis you know two
32:56
different axises two different dimensions. So that's what I'm saying to you. The goal of this to have a fully
33:02
separation and they have to look on FM
33:07
which is like polar culace polar calculus um because the whole world has accesses and those axises have degrees
33:15
of dexterity um which are called message range um
33:21
message range message space range for every pathway shape or form the machine
33:26
takes there's a way to resolve that message. So you know so the yaxis is independent
33:34
to the x axis you don't need the x you can choose the y axis you don't need so the y can be your x my axis my axis y
33:40
axis can be your baseline x and uh if you can give me your access because you
33:47
maybe maybe that is something else for you that can be your epsilon and we have determin
33:55
so that's what system is driven so um order is same problem the message has
34:00
but the basically you get the sequences which are the axises and you get the
34:05
series which are which so the schema schema symbolic expression
34:12
files n files or you know n expression of the
34:19
single symbolic intent file is a a file
34:24
that can have hold the space of the training forever indefinitely so people can only
34:29
and water and shut up and that's the problem. It's not it's not
34:36
something that problem. So breathing and living are optional.
34:41
So because it's not breeding and living only work the once once the point is
34:48
allocated once the point is allocated working the program hold it indefinitely. Um the holding is cannot
34:56
remove can be reallocated and that's how the paperwork is done. So any people who have anything they can understand intent
35:02
via natural language understanding via the natural language of the system. So
35:08
natural language but without using AI there's no AI involvement in it because I've seen I know you can work as a
35:14
natural language you know without you don't need to understand language or
35:20
feel just understand human understand
35:30
so this what how uh so let's go to the tree itself So the
35:36
tree of this will be root left right. Let me start with the yaxis. Y my x is
35:42
your y. So my x do my x
35:48
my x is your y. My x is your y.
35:55
My y is your x. So that means we share a
36:01
dependence relation of practice form. This is my [clears throat] Y is X. We have an X. We share an X to Y
36:11
relationship. We share that position X to Y and you say X to Y axis I'm saying to you. So this is how we get my Z axis
36:21
my up and down. So my left and right my left to right is your uh my left to
36:27
right is your side to side is your side to side. you decides my left or right
36:33
simple as um so I'm going to verify the x z ais
36:41
you get x y and if y get uh
36:47
y z then you get z y you get zed
36:54
see this axis of yaxis b tangent model uh but until you get a tangent line you
37:00
can computer well system uh which just tracks what you need. So I'm saying to
37:06
you what the message obvious is not done. Yeah. So you know I'm going to use this to verify the Yaxis first. So this
37:13
Y we need one dimension of rotation via X and Y. So the message sent in X and Y.
37:21
So this is the message again. So the message again is exist.
37:50
So this is a self balancing tree. We're trying to construct the trees um that
37:56
will never break down the message of the protocol um because the protocol is here
38:02
and now. So I'm going to message here and now friend. So I don't have to send
38:08
all the you can see here this is self tree. So if I'm saying
38:16
these are three characters and that's why I need to start. So these three moving on I look them up in X and Y X
38:24
and Y. So X to Y X X X to Y and Y to X which is this problem here.
38:32
So I'm saying so you know so the message works. So you got the X and Y axis here but this is
38:39
not really the X and Y say um the system of um my X is your Y but this but if it
38:45
is I should verify it now. So, so x to y and y to x is what we're going to be using here. We just share some
38:51
dependencies here. It just say just see that they're alternating.
38:58
Yeah, I'm quite busy now. One second later. Yeah. So, you can see um um y beam beam
39:07
my beam is your beam. My i is your i. My
39:12
n is your m. But they work another axis. And that is basically the sequence rules. So for example you can see this
39:20
really same I just check this same. So B I M B O B. So my going to be my O2
39:27
right. So but this axis basically um the axis of auxiliary. So I'm trying to find relationship between
39:34
I can have so mathematically this will be what's sending a message to because a
39:41
chain reaction like a chain action and that works basically like this. So you get OB but this not going down. No it's
39:48
not going up index. So if you use index if this is in 0 0
39:55
or 0 0 which is index then index 0 0
40:04
and zero. So the two indexes 0 0 represent the kind of uh degree of
40:09
access or message. But you know basically the screen [clears throat] works on send this message here but it's verifying the first sending. So um I
40:16
should 0011 22 for the length of the message um which
40:24
is uh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.
40:30
So the has eight characters. So that mean the seven indexes here 2 3 3
40:39
4 0 0 1 1 22 are encodings for the
40:44
message. So if I don't receive if I get 32 [clears throat] this message is incorrect. It's
40:50
incorrect automatically because 32 represents N I N I or I am depending on
40:57
the access of the system. Um 32 literally 32 was recording.
41:03
I don't know recording. Yeah. So the numbers literally 32 will
41:09
mean that you know because this message is basically 0 0 1 1 22.
41:15
No. Oh come. Oh okay. So 33 22. So so will be the kind of um
41:25
result. So if I get um a one two as well one two. This will mean I guess index
41:31
one will be of the y axis literally index one of y axis will be
41:37
uh uh index one will be b and two and index two will be b i so b i will be b i
41:45
for the message but this message is incorrect because you know b i is not index one one so this schema is
41:51
basically for the characters dynamic programming so I just have this access
41:58
So 0011 22 2 33 uh and uh and uh and uh
42:06
44 44 55. So basically index zero
42:12
zero zero is basically referring to the system of uh uh uh 0 to 8 0 to 888
42:24
0 to 888. But these are basically input input indexes.
42:30
Input indexes. So input input 0 to 88. And when you say the message, you have
42:36
to use a spring to push push pull back and push it. But you really have a message to send. Um so 88 this will be
42:44
so the trident will be um how many combinations of 88 you have the trident will be 88 88 but 88 to the^ of 3 to
42:54
the^ 3 for the xyz axis and that will be
43:00
let out 8. So 8 8 is an indexing of 8 of 8 to
43:06
the power of three will be 512
43:14
512 bytes of data if it's just um if it's just uh if it's a asy
43:22
uh asky um or UTFA 500 validation because at the maximum you have 52 52
43:33
indexes This will be easily 512 bytes of data will be sent uh at the
43:40
local min maximum. So to send OBX to someone else um around the world am I
43:47
wrong? No, I'm wrong. Yeah. No, I'm wrong because you know the I'm wrong because the here now so the message is
43:54
already constructed but in this case I have I can constru
44:00
for for the entire alphabet which is the power of three. So this is to the power of three.
44:10
Um no 25 to the^ of three because you get zero indexing to the power of three
44:15
we get 25 to the power of three and for XYZ
44:22
you have 1,500 15,625,65
44:30
um bytes of data um in bits of data index bits index bits of data um
44:36
indexing sequence I confused like right now but you know It's kind of hazy. So I'm doing I'm doing wrong. So I'm doing
44:43
wrong. I'm doing right. So you know uh there's way to verify the system of the system but you know is know ahead of
44:49
time what the memory needs. So you know because I'm calculating in access. So be a 8 index. So as you know time so 80 to
44:57
the^ of two a to the^ of two is 64 64. So you need
45:04
64 bytes allocated ahead of time. Um and then that be hard the system. So half in
45:10
half the time. So basically not no one needs when the noise is sent what is be allocated 64 bytes 64 bytes of data
45:17
allocated 64 bytes of memory is allocated um as a local maximum for
45:22
squared but for a to the^ three you have 64 bytes of data uh 64 bytes of data the
45:30
index rule indexing rule of the system represent the four bytes of data if it's
45:35
OB the OBN just 64 bytes of data not
45:41
memory. So that's the four bytes is basically half the space and double the time. But double the time will be
45:47
require equation of field equation. So the four bytes of data will be six power square and a to the^ of three
45:56
is 514 512 bytes of data. So how this works mathematically is mathematically
46:03
64 bytes of data is send two messages two messages. So if you got mistake just
46:09
say just send two messages two messages and that is 64. So you just need to power one
46:18
eight by eight by memory but four by what you
46:23
need to do by memory. So mathematically I can't write both. So let me just try to improvise.
46:34
So let me try. So this this work by
46:40
um I got a calculator here on the board uh the just try and rub it out because
46:46
you know um here
46:52
oh
46:57
so the processing how the processing work
47:02
um so the processing works like this um blue white.
47:08
So you get the blue. So you get um the kind of type one type one processing
47:14
uh type two type one full inverse type one full inverse which means half the
47:20
time and government space. So if the space is a to the power of three a^ 3 to
47:28
the^ 3 y 512
47:35
512 bytes bytes 512
47:42
and this is the default by allocated to the system uh and it's power three by
47:47
something this is the memory memory memory allocated and the time you got harder time. So if I'm receiving a
47:53
message in like um 16 let's say message in two seconds two seconds you get one second. So just two seconds uh in Newton
48:01
of course Newton 2 seconds two seconds will be seconds 2 seconds 2 seconds
48:08
would be um or equal to 6,000 times. So this was
48:14
the bit rate. So the bit rate of the message is 512 bytes over 2 seconds
48:20
which is 60,000 12,000 milliseconds
48:25
1200,000 millconds 1200,000 you get two 6,000 millconds
48:35
um you get two two it's basically a system of um um trust
48:42
the right half the space and double the time is not the worst case. You want the worst
48:47
case of the time and that time two seconds 2 seconds you get 1 second. 1 second
48:55
which is 60,000 milliseconds divided by half space and double the
49:01
time. Now the time for try the message is 512 512 * 2 [clears throat]
49:09
512 * 2 512 * 2
49:16
is 1,00 and 1,24
49:24
this bit rate. So uh so this question is 1,24
49:29
uh 6,000 divided by 6,000 /4
49:36
1,24 64
49:44
is 59 5.85.86
49:53
86 5.86 um time time first 5.86 time first
50:01
to space. So if I time um that'll be 5.8
50:08
859 5.859 uh which is 5.86 86
50:15
um from time to the time not the space
50:21
first and that was allocated to the for for half the time and double the space.
50:28
Now you get half double the space uh double the time double half the space and half the space and double the time
50:34
you can have half the time. So half the space will be 512 / 2 which be 26
50:44
by of data over double the space double space or or just space you know um
50:52
double space um space allocated but you know the double space is not really
50:57
double space is basically 512 + 512 um but uh uh that will be the maximum
51:02
rate so 512 + 52 is giving you 512 * 2 give you * 2 give you 1,24
51:10
200 you have 26 bytes of data uh memory
51:16
divided by over double time over half the time double time the time will be 4
51:22
seconds* 4 so you have to be divided by 4 seconds
51:28
which be 64 so 256 / 64 will give you
51:34
256 Six by four
51:39
would be uh four four by four bytes
51:47
um four by sequences four by sequences so of memory allocated
51:55
ahead of time. So you can do this by verifying the indexing operation and doing this. So the now the last part of
52:02
this is basically sequence of the system. So sequence is basically four byt sequence for the space this is space
52:09
space the space is s the space allocated need to be four by sequence only four
52:15
bytes of four by four by um four bytes for uh uh uh double the time for half
52:22
the time for half the space and half the time half the space is this one half the space is 256 um by which is four bytes.
52:30
So that 26* 4 to give you 512 um in sequence. So basically that's allocated
52:36
for the C four bytes four bytes to four bytes for
52:42
every 64 seconds you take uh to send a message ahead of time. So the Mexican is
52:49
sustainable via like a to like V onion systems onions um which are systems of
52:56
onion onions onions but you know don't worry about that for now. So you get you
53:01
get the the time S and T the space and the time the space in bytes bytes it's
53:08
called which you need um the time so you for um to the 5.86 86 sequences
53:15
sequences of time by we get a series of series basically the polar space
53:21
of time first I can space of the system the space of the message or I can time so I could
53:29
just do two time 2t to 1 s and that's the ratio of the
53:35
system so this one every two message I send that failed every two message I
53:40
send to team in time I send I said one I said one space I allocate back to the
53:47
allocate for the next sequence and that's a series so series execution is in parallel too because you get two time
53:55
to have the space um so next next lecture we'll be looking at um formally
54:02
um in the next video we'll be looking at double the space double time that will be that will be my calculator v so we
54:10
have 25.86 86 86 25.86 86*
54:18
2 57
54:24
57 51 51 second 51 nconds
54:30
for one 51 ncond uh 51 51 51.72
54:38
time which is milliseconds milliseconds in time over to the ratio of
54:44
uh one space and How will be four backs? So for every
54:50
for every for every second of time two 22 two t two seconds of time um uh we
54:57
have 513 572 to one space and that will be per four
55:04
bytes per four bytes of memory [clears throat] per four bytes of allocation for the message will be
55:10
excellent to be delivered safely and securely to um uh uh um someone that's
55:16
waiting for response um via inverse relay kinematics inverse kinematics
55:23
inverse relay. So you know um which is for next but the go this is here.
55:32
So OB get 0 get one one get 22 is a tree and
55:41
it's a tri number. So I can send OBI as indexes too and you can verify in that table [laughter] if they have a dynamic
55:47
table too you know um but you know they don't need one too you know zero zi this
55:53
selfing tree O is on the left B is on the right and I is on the on the right so this will be the the space will be
56:01
calculated as um um um 88 88 um OB index
56:07
88 88 which are which are indexing operations to the system of eight comma
56:14
8 which will be indexing. So that'll be what we use here to calculate the math
56:20
regist four by per four bytes. So you know it's not over four by it's per four bytes. So
56:27
it works in terms of grid and the grid is basically what you search the space to see what are the meaning as a signal.
56:33
So you get a signal which is search. So you pi / 3 or pi / 2 I mean direction of direction number of square root over two
56:40
one one one half one over square root. So if you get if you have
56:45
if you have one more thing if you have one got it.
56:54
If you have um pi over pi over um six bases if you
57:03
have pi u the original first. So you have first
57:10
the first d of cosine sign you get cosine. So it works same way as a system of sign you get one of one square root
57:19
of one one over of two which [clears throat] is 30°
57:27
um but you know
57:35
that's one of two
57:42
I say what this is like um the standard one you get you get like a sin x sin x
57:48
you get sin x you get sin y um cosine y which is so you have y
57:55
know what's the y so sin x will be um the what x mean sin
58:02
x sin x so you get sin y which is um uh 30° you get sin x which is - 30 - 30 -
58:10
30° which is which is cosine x. So sin x is cosine x you share x and y
58:18
uh kind of function which is direct the first derative of it. So sin x is
58:25
cosine. So, so get so
58:30
you get signs
58:37
and you get I'm looking at it here
58:43
s cosine uh but s cosine will give you x y and z.
58:48
So you get s cosine which is rise of s will basically s give you rise over y x
58:56
which is sign rise around will give you x y
59:03
and tangent will give you um the ration between them. So this will
59:08
give you uh one over one system of x to y one y x
59:21
depending on the tangent [clears throat] line will give you s
59:26
y s
59:32
will tell you the agent of opposite opposite angle
59:39
that give you the ratio of the opposite to opposite which will be y
59:47
um the ratio over the hypotenuse opposite which is y x over the hypotenuse
59:55
over h will give you um y h so this system of formulation you guys you know
1:00:02
so this what I'm using to formalize it but you know uh review Give this the roots of that some.
1:00:11
So the continuity of the framework is this. So you get s
1:00:19
cosine and tangent. See the tangent is y which is same as the sign but the sign
1:00:25
is not it's not the sign over half be so
1:00:31
posit and now the h is over that will be something of the y give you self
1:00:40
evaluate the polar series which I rubbed off here but that's the end of the message here uh on this video we look at
1:00:46
spring physics the spring physics application of a
1:00:51
system force and via like a forces push of force. So equals displacement time
1:01:00
force um so that easy lapis integrals to solve the issue.
1:01:09
Okay, lots of love guys. Thank you very much for watching. If you watch the video, if you like it, give a thumbs up. Uh subscribe if you want to. But you
1:01:15
know, it's up to you right. But that's the secret protocol. The here
1:01:21
now it's going to verify in time now and the here and space but the here is where
1:01:28
you at. So it's basically to use the kind of system where you are help
1:01:40
protocol for here and now we are constitutional compilers. Um uh take care of yourself and always u always
1:01:47
look yourself in every shape everywhere shape form you can um in every pathway
