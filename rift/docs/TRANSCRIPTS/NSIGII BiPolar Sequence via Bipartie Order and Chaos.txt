Yes. Okay. So, good. Yeah. Today's date is um the 30th of January 30th of
0:10
January. This timeline is 5:39 a.m. 38 a.m. Um let me just open a new document.
0:19
Yeah. So uh this basically in sigi um the title of this video is as you see
0:26
it's basically sigi um order should go along like ini trident package
0:32
verification via uh bipolar cisco order and chaos separation concern uh create
0:37
destroy renew repair. So I mean what is clear today but you
0:42
know just tonight. So let me just start uh with the kind of um what we do today
0:49
here. So the board you can see the board here.
0:54
You see the board in space have a space around. So this is
1:00
so um diagram here. So this is diagram here.
1:09
So um just so if you can if you remember um if you can uh
1:17
if you can rebuild something you can
1:24
break it really you can do if you do something you can
1:29
break it if you can create something
1:38
session to temporary something you can destroy it. Can destroy it.
1:46
If you can do something, you can break it. You can say you can you can break it. If you can
1:55
repair something, you can renew it. Renew it.
2:02
Uh but this model is basically the title of um what's title here.
2:09
Uh chaos order of concern. You know these three things is what an enzyme does like saliva uh saliva can
2:19
uh so if you if you have why this works model works it's kind of data model but the problem with this model is um you
2:26
have to have something isolated for example an enzyme a saliva enzyme doesn't have a nucle nucleus saliva
2:33
itself like my spit does not co saliva does not have a nucleus it just so it doesn't it
2:42
just don't touch perfectly. It doesn't need any more any more nodes. So the
2:47
propation has just there's no there's no nucle. It's made by protein in saliva glands.
2:54
So example can break food down. Saliva breaks food down. Keeps breaking food
3:00
down keeps breaking breaking food down. It doesn't rebuild. It doesn't rebuild itself because it just collects it just
3:07
keep just it just get reproduced by saliva glands and saliva gland um in your esophagus from your to your
3:16
which is your esophagus your your tonsils after the tonsils your esophagus which your your diaphragm which your
3:23
voice your diaphragm get your esophagus and then you get your saliva somewhere
3:29
in there you know in the village village of saliva.
3:36
So saliva doesn't need to um break doesn't break itself. It's rebuild
3:42
itself. But itself just collects more saliva to solve the problem. It doesn't um take
3:48
more saliva and um it doesn't need to. So it just has a nucleus nucleus or one
3:53
nuclei you know have a nucleus and that nucleus will begin to multiply multiply
3:59
and does not multiply it does not multiply it just grows at a steady constant rate and that is not
4:04
exponential because you cannot you cannot it's not a cell it's not a cell it's a saliv
4:14
organism but it does a job as a system it's a it's not a conscious organism per
4:19
se but it's self which can divide and make purpose and self can create itself but can only
4:29
break stuff. So can break stuff but not itself. It can break things down food
4:35
down but not itself. It cannot rebuild itself. Rebuild food structures can
4:41
break stuff. So if I close to saliva and cause break I need if I if I cannot
4:48
rebuild what can I do? if I'm going to rebuild myself uh I
4:54
cannot repair myself or renew myself and I cannot um great
5:03
so what I can do is destroy destroy destroy and this is see this diag it's
5:10
all d and to have message
5:16
that respects this principle of uh break uh break
5:22
and crit you have you have two crates you have one destroyed that's it but the system has to verify itself all at some
5:29
point in time in time so how this works speaking is
5:38
order and chaos is there in the system or is there chaos two sides of equation so other people potential equation some
5:47
define some kind of a a freedom. So you get um the equation of the system you
5:53
get u if I want to create a destroyer and send a message and what I'm going to do
5:59
I want to show you two sides. So you have two post sides order
6:07
uh chaos which has two sequences of instruction order and chaos order
6:14
refers to um is the system coherent order is it working against itself am I
6:21
am I am I was this program um crash
6:26
try packet and the beauty of this is that Order is order. If you get order,
6:33
you get chaos. So you check chaos for order just by observing
6:39
the dimension of order and chaos where the program was running
6:44
for the frequ. So this is a this is a bar python system
6:50
by bar python system that knows what is doing via observer cons. He knows
6:56
observes and then consume. the observed act um or an act of order act of chaos.
7:03
Um so if order means um building stuff, breaking stuff, building stuff or create
7:08
more stuff can also panic and have chaos and break stuff and move stuff.
7:14
If means build stuff, create stuff and uh and if order sequence order sequence
7:21
is uh build
7:30
um you know uh builds repair
7:37
builds and crates repairs crates
7:42
bill
7:49
is straight. So what
7:55
you want? So if there's a is
8:05
a close is um
8:12
If the order is um
8:18
uh uh uh renew repair, renew, repair,
8:24
build and uh uh create
8:30
a session like a temporary session if I can uh so if I say take orders create something first um then I I repair
8:40
create something, renew it, renew it, build, renew it, then build it, then
8:46
build it and bring repair. So I'm saying so the secret is
8:52
uh create create a session
8:58
create then create uh renew
9:06
renew. Then the first about to break uh
9:12
build. Oh, so crates crates then. So crates uh
9:22
so crates rebuild crates build the new
9:27
thing. Uh uh repair, renew, renew, renew, repair, renew, repair. Okay.
9:37
Uh place build, repair, renew, renew,
9:44
repair, then renew, repair,
9:50
then renew. Um concern
9:57
so this older one be this is a create build repair renew but there's no m yet
10:04
but this is the order sequence this order so you get the opposite which is the opposite order which is the chaos
10:15
chaos system you get um create destroy destroy so you get destroy
10:23
or break. Uh repair repair
10:35
and uh uh repair
10:41
renew and repair and repair
10:49
and then finally Yeah. So you get opposite of the total opposite of the board here. So the top creation here. So
10:57
if you go to vote here as you can see the chaos here is destroy
11:05
v break and repair but I'm going to go to the match now but the older sequence
11:11
is your run and what's video about the verifier what I'm talking about here. So I'm
11:17
going to do water. the trident the trident packet. So uh for because you know you got three
11:24
messages three so the goal is three three consensus three try to two um two
11:30
packets two packets of verification. So you have three or two mapping of the
11:36
system. So the order is um if the order is on you get two um you can also check the order can check the order or you can
11:44
check the chaos um checking the chaos you might as you need to take two two maximum so you can
11:51
take a sequence of order one order and one chaos you can have a system of two
11:56
orders one order one chaos and two chaos
12:02
two chaos two c O C 2 C O this will mean that order and
12:09
chaos into if the message is three try the message three messages okay springs
12:15
which is spring to this you have again two orders to solve that message or so
12:22
the goal of this go the whole time whole time point is that the message is can be 512 bytes
12:36
over over over
12:42
space.
12:47
So the heart destroy break. So you know it doesn't matter chaos
12:54
chaos to so mathematically this one like spring
13:01
physics spring for the spring. Let me get my other um um um um choke. So let
13:09
me do some water first. Dusty as hell.
13:18
Let me just
13:30
So triplets triplets triplet the me threes threes and triplets
13:37
the triplets is basically 512 *
13:49
for the word OBI Nexus 512 * 3
13:55
is 1,00 312 bytes is 3 uh is 1,56
14:06
bytes and 52 bytes over
14:12
time. Um, so half the message will be 512 bytes
14:20
by two give you 256 23 bytes divid 23 bytes um
14:26
in half the message half the message um half the message um and double the time
14:33
double time will be uh two seconds. So I've done the time that be 2 seconds. 2
14:38
seconds will be 4 seconds* 4 seconds will be 1,24
14:45
bytes um bit rate um bytes per second transferred.
14:53
Oh bits per second transferred 124 bits per second. No bytes per second
14:59
transferred. Um uh um two seconds for for every 4 seconds. All right. For
15:06
every 4 seconds. So per per four byes which is is so this video now I have
15:14
time. So let me just clean the board.
15:19
So I'm going to now here
15:29
I'm going to keep this and move it here.
15:47
to get you to break.
15:58
So you get the order Let's
16:06
do
16:29
destroy. It's truly great.
17:15
Clear to me.
17:37
Okay. And so God destroyed break and then break God.
17:45
Destroy break opposite
17:51
is opposite of
18:19
Okay. Okay. So my goal is to have this sequence work now Cisco model. So uh so
18:25
we got again 3 to two.
18:32
So let's take two. So let's do G. So let's do properly again. So we have a
18:40
message of 512 bytes long divided by 3. Okay, this is 124 $1,25 by 3 um by three
18:49
in the best 512 byid 3.
18:56
Okay, let me computer. 512 bytes of data divided by um uh calculator. Let me do
19:04
calculator shift it three times. So that'll be a scientific calculator that
19:09
will be programming or octo binary
19:14
512 bytes. So we have this in decimal 512 bytes in
19:22
decimal uh 512 bytes in decimal in binary. That's 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
19:34
divided by uh decimal
19:39
3. That will give you 512 3 in decimal. In
19:45
binary that's 170 in decimal. In binary that's um one um uh zero
19:55
in decimal. So you get 512 / 3 which is
20:02
1 0 1.
20:10
So the first problem with this here this is two homogeneous um transistors can fail. So transition just one. So it's
20:18
not really it's really more problem but the first one I want to say for data is
20:24
dynamic program. This can be resolved dynamically. The number just 17 over a range over a range of values. But we're
20:31
going to stick with one 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
20:37
from the right side or right NDS model for 170.
20:42
170 this number was 170 17 by 3 is 170 in binary
20:49
in binary. um in decimal um and then you get a decimal is one zero one zero one
20:55
zero 1 zero and that's 170 in decimal for three packets three packets now the
21:02
bipolar will be the var go through the process of using repair you know
21:08
creating the message it chaos see something goes wrong it's
21:14
uh it will start to break so so if if it get before if it gets to chaos can
21:20
compute ahead of time for the opposite of destruction. So let's say um the the
21:25
message uh start destroy somewhere um you know the message is uh um uh um OB
21:32
Nexus OBR Nexus which is 52 bytes long
21:41
but this so we get we get uh uh
21:48
we get some for characters here we get
21:55
um U X. So we get instead of OBX we get O
22:05
and O I get some corrupted um OI
22:12
for V I get um N we get
22:17
we get empty we get empty
22:23
epsilon which I call cross for empty so I cross epsilon o i epsilon or cut it
22:32
up and then we get um o i epsilon for nothing and we get u
22:40
theta for n um because data is in the message scheme
22:46
as well for yes no and maybe I will get uh epsilon
22:51
again I will get u one more
22:56
uh X and we get no
23:02
we get one more epsilon we get we get X we get X X we get X X X we get X
23:14
or we get U and S
23:21
so the system here so we got theta so these are the miracle
23:27
Unless the packet works. So you get the problem is dynamic programming. First of all, that's the first problem. Can we
23:32
get 170? Yes. In the range of values that's equal to one over 200, you know,
23:38
and just as a result, but the problem here mainly is this problem here. So we
23:43
got uh we go, we got B, we get I but I is basically
23:51
the wrong message. So how can we check if I is B is not I? Uh, my B is your I
23:56
cuz you send back an I. This means you send back an I. Um, OB.
24:03
So you send back an I. That means the message is wrong. The wrong. So you send back. So I sent OB Nex. I sent O for
24:10
Oscar, B for Bravo, I for India, N for E for Echo, X for X-ray, U for umbrella, S
24:16
for Sarah. Oh, OB Nex. You send me O for India, I for indigo, epsilon,
24:22
data, epsilon, x, x for extra for x. So
24:28
you can check that O, X and U S are fine. But why does no why do we have I
24:34
when I have O B. This basically the problem of inverse polar systems. So
24:39
that's why so this problem matters. So solution is gen programming to set up a table. Yes. And the table is there for
24:46
OBX. So we get B get I and that I is epsilon
24:51
I is so your I is my B. So you give me your I and this message is no right message. So I'm to verify the message
24:58
too. So uh I have used to order C from so um I have to either renew your be so
25:06
I have a function function that renew. So I created I built it I have repaired
25:11
and and I renew it. So you have now found that I can destroy it build break it and repair it just full operation
25:18
full function that maps to this problem of this problem here. So O is fine. O is fine. I verified I didn't need to send O
25:24
again. Um but you know now send um okay so the home message is back you know um
25:29
you send me I send I don't need to touch I don't need to touch I need to tamper with the message. Oh you send me I I
25:37
check your B is not I so I have to give you my B. So I have to shuffle again. So I have to say but I'll give you so you
25:43
gave me index um OB your index um my index 00
25:50
one one two I should give you two my index two um I give you my index two so
25:56
I give you my index two I give you index one one and that would be B because we share is B one one um
26:04
and then we get um epsilon now epsilon is n but n is empty so what is epsilon
26:10
so you have to look United States and this is really a value message here that can be corrected here can be very corrupt absolutely like empty message
26:17
empty message for I I because you know I came from this one here so it may have
26:23
shifted because you didn't give me be so I is more it's more it's more humane
26:29
it's more like made a mistake so I I I'm just doing guys with this message here
26:34
making look right so I I so you give me epsilon epsilon here What does epsilon
26:41
mean? Epsilon means nothing. You have you give me you give me so you get this ep give me your epsilon. Now as you
26:48
slash that is your epsilon. It's basically e with a slash but my look at me. So my sign this is your epsilon. So
26:57
you give you don't know what this is. You don't know you don't know what this I is. So I'm telling you you don't know
27:04
what. So I have to replace it. So I have to what? Renew it. Renew it. to give you r and that to give you index 1 one and
27:12
index 22 and a theta you you're you sure what
27:17
this um uh n is so you are thinking is that n so I have to um now uh we knew
27:26
the m so the n will be uh index 33 this mean it's going forward and seven
27:32
so index 33 or your your
27:39
normally read the alphabet or the polar inverse minus one
27:44
and um be minus three and three so I can give you minus3 your negative number so
27:52
it works like that so I can give you -3 and three you know3 is three so I give
28:00
you the opposite you don't know what that is so I give you3 and three so I give you three packets maximum So 33 or3
28:07
and3 and3 for3 and3 or or 3 and3 I give three
28:15
messages maximum uh two at a time of course depending on the kind of order you are on and you get x as always so
28:23
the the the message now so there's no negatives here so you get three or three
28:30
or you get um um the polar inverse which is B negative. So you are working on you're
28:37
working negative you're working on the your the polar will be3 because you're working on the an operator from the
28:43
right side. So the right side will be basically because you're doing right side operation will be x which means
28:49
like x operation that will save uh the bite of data but you know the back will
28:54
be x or minus x. So you're giving me your minus exclusive operator that works on um that remembers the state of the x.
29:02
It's basically a negative operator something for the structure. So if the X structure the the polar inverse will
29:09
open on the right end the minus will be the right hand NDS or the left hand NDS
29:14
of the ecosystem and that's how the works. So the message in the end will be
29:20
verify ahead of time via spring physics spring says double time. So I send them
29:26
this message. I send I I see three IC2. So I give you two. So the resultant will
29:33
be uh the system will be u
29:39
one one 22 uh -3
29:47
because you next3 you because there's chaos because you
29:54
don't know what this I give you3 and three and three because this three will
29:59
give you Um 1 2 3 4
30:05
1 2 3 will give you maybe give you the data and data will be either -3 or three
30:12
based on axis of model of the axis I'm working on cuz you know this index so
30:17
you get both you get oi n e o i n at the
30:23
end will be the third index depending on the x operator you working on. So how
30:29
the x operator work this is a fast spot last part of it just remember the system of x system operator but they are both
30:37
pole so if you get a negative x got positive side if you get a positive side get and that's what the poles do but
30:44
they work on multiplication because they work they're dynamic they're dynamic so they work on multiplication so they work
30:50
on on kind of system of multipliers and addition and scalability because the
30:56
express work so let me roll this out show The final for the system.
31:01
So the first will be
31:15
the final system all the system will be
31:22
um so so u so this x operator will be operating on the inverse. So um if I
31:29
have um um um the if I didn't have um
31:35
this is ASI systems. So if I now convert this to O to B asking um OB is ASI let
31:44
me get you some let me set a good ask converter
31:50
as converter converter
31:58
um ask I I'm busy yeah I'm how are you mate
32:04
yeah I'm good asking sele
32:09
uh OBI indexes as uh uh OBS and capitals
32:14
will be um so if I use the B cover of OBS you know I would just have the hex
32:20
decimal the by the hex in by so that um
32:27
42 4 f
32:32
so we have x so we get table uh uh table of here. Uh
32:43
4 F 4 F 42
32:49
42 uh 49. No.
32:57
So I have to take the message here. So, so we have so we have to take what
33:04
the system was. So that will be um 42 the so you get the two message you have
33:11
to have nex and uh the in um the the phone messages to work. So that's what
33:18
I'm doing now. I'm writing out hexodimal digits. Uh E.
33:24
So the first three parts of O I O I O I. So get 49. Yeah. So 49.
33:35
I'll get I O. O is 4 F.
33:44
4 f is 4 f you know 4 f so we get 4 f we don't
33:49
change we get x or 4 f which equal to 4 f in the long which is
33:58
all all exclusive which should be one so be one exclusive so that be 4 f 4 f 4f
34:07
which should be one which should be one which should be 4 f at the end now we
34:12
get pos2 2 x or 42 or 49. Um, so I'm
34:17
going to preserve the 40 42. So for the two will be the original message
34:24
B for the two decimal
34:36
that be 42 decimal which should be uh oh so I'm trying to do 42 um O all O
34:44
priority or zero so I have to get 42 so I have to use the tree model of system.
34:50
So that will be so I'm getting so 42 and I've flipped I've changed it I've
34:56
reorganized I've gotten so indic 22 22 two 01 01
35:04
this will be one one so I have to use the indexing of one one this is of one this is 01
35:10
this is this is of this is of 01 22 so I have to change index 22 to one one
35:19
and that will give be 22 to 1 one and that be 22 22 to 1 one.
35:28
So that be 22 to 111 and that will be correct. So 211 will be
35:37
uh uh uh uh 211 will be um b
35:46
and that will be the message. But this oper O I I should be a B. But index B
35:53
will be I you know if I no so I remember I used this moment. So what's
36:00
once I reverse the index once I change back to I didn't apply the X4 operator
36:05
again or I can do the X operator for your table from your table or my table
36:11
your table what you saw. So I'm I'm going to give you the index one again and that will be one one that will be
36:17
all. So will be so this should be verified here. This will be verified here.
36:22
So I actually comput when when you when you verify message over X or you'll get
36:29
another message message parity message the parity the parity sequence will give
36:34
you the result you need. So that's basically what you change for that message and that's how that works. So
36:40
you have OBI u O is fine B is not fine.
36:46
So I have to change the two two to one one and that's verified. So now that
36:51
will be one one and I have um um data epsilon epsilon will be
36:58
uh epsilon will be um either I
37:04
is nothing nothing so you don't know what this is. So I would say um I'll give you uh 49. 49
37:13
I'll give you 49 cuz you change to 49. So we have 49
37:18
via the X operator. So now I get this becomes I now. So I give you I you don't
37:25
know what it is. I give you theta. Theta now theta is basically you sure what
37:30
this is. This is an N. N this N can be if you're balanced. So n will be uh n e
37:37
n e or n or i.
37:44
So my n can be your i. No, you if you say my n can be your uh look my
37:51
can be your can be your e. I my is your e. My e is your x and my x is your s. Uh
38:00
as you can see. So because I'm giving you an egg, you don't know what is yours. I'm depending this in E or X. So
38:07
I'll give you um I have to shift your view. So I have
38:12
to change the direction. So I just give you my table. So I have to give you two halves um left. Give you the direction.
38:19
So I have to give you two halves left. So if you think this is s one table
38:24
share, one will share. You're thinking that this is um this what is coded. This is how it's so
38:32
positive but you know I'll give you data and this will be x. So I'll give you
38:39
uh uh shift to shift of view uh minus one minus 2
38:46
uh direct minus two. So as you can see I got end
38:52
of November which is X and X
39:00
SU. So you think you think I'm giving I you
39:06
think I'm giving you I I you're giving I'm giving you I I O
39:14
but you know um you don't show where that line. You can say this is something
39:19
you say. So let me switch to the power. So the power will be x5. So you start with the x. So I I'm giving you u maybe
39:27
so maybe maybe it's n but maybe it's n
39:32
but maybe it's um something close to m which is m
39:41
it's either e i or m. You think it's either EI or EI or I N E. So this will
39:48
be um N sorry this will be N
39:55
uh N E I I N E uh which is like the
40:01
roots left right depending on what's the root. So I'm giving you an S. So you don't know where to start from because
40:07
you don't you don't know where you are at. So I will consume this table I I I is on the right that I on the is on the
40:14
right N is on the root and E is on the right left and I'll give you what it is.
40:20
So I can give you this table to look up. I can give you this whole table to look out but I give you the answer give you
40:26
the whole substruct.
40:38
So that'll be um I N E.
40:51
So in would be the Cisco model of int.
41:00
So, so this I N and A will be um um um the one of So I'm giving you an I
41:08
what is this M and that M will be something that
41:14
N because you know this M so that's maybe basically
41:20
what you end on the table between I and E I'm
41:25
going to give you the midway between the middle if I go X which is X and Y axis
41:33
OB Nexus which is on that's the Y axis where is M where is N if you have OB IS
41:42
BB I so N I N E N E will be N E will be
41:48
here. So here we have I I
42:03
So as you see here I have I I am E M and
42:09
I have um u um E M uh I mean E uh I E I
42:19
I I N and E N. So this basically what so I'm going to find the M can be it can be
42:26
anything anything in this set or everything to anything in this set. So anything in this set will be N M. So
42:33
that will be um index index one index one two three
42:42
one two uh one two one two one two three two for
42:48
number 3 three so let's go three go three so whatever
42:55
whatever the whatever the um I is so if I'm if I'm if I'm an I I have to move uh
43:01
uh one One row, one row. I I one I I this I I have to use one one right one
43:09
right one right one right and one down to get
43:15
an end. If I So I have to use one right one down one down which is up down left
43:21
right axis of um uh the robot which is really depending if I start on
43:28
f um x on y to x. So if I start from the Y to X execution up, I I used to use one
43:35
right um which is um I I used to go one right one down to get to N. Uh one down,
43:43
one down, one one down the axis of the Y axis. So one right on the X axis one
43:49
down. And if I go um um um if I start from one right, you get YX get one M. I
43:57
start from one end I get one down one down. So depending if the
44:03
message is message is maybe confuse the subset. So this is basically can be in
44:09
anything of the subset or everything but the sub the subset is basically one map to one up one down. So this is a table
44:15
you look up table. So I give a sequence instruction can resolve the system based on whatever the current sense of what
44:22
was. So decimal. So I don't show you though you guys know I'm maybe so the message is now incomplete but you know
44:28
uh I've got less time to do it. So uh I'm showing you has to take some go with it. So you know so because the table uh
44:35
this you got to compute ahead of time uh not ahead of time why is wronghead of time computation here here because you
44:43
don't need it to do it. So, so you get um one right one down um one for I I and
44:53
you get uh one right one down for I I and you get
45:02
uh um for I I one one
45:09
uh one down for I N
45:15
and you get um one for E for E R you get
45:21
uh one left one left axis rotation one which is not one rotation not a
45:28
you can you can do you can do rotation you can
45:34
do also transformations you can do standard rotation joint yeah rotation of axis rotation rotate rotation reflection
45:44
uh uh uh uh rotation reflection of the axis based on theta
45:52
being you know obviously this is the 2 pi r to one I mean one to two pi r one
46:00
one full is 2 pi r which is par of travel uh you get um you get one to you
46:07
get 2 pi r to 26 um to pi point which is the area of search space. So P out
46:16
search space and how you do this directly is um you know you have to verify that you know you're searching right space um based on the dimensions
46:22
of the problem you're working on basically a color you can have I'm to have where the hypo canvas is used to
46:31
have this as a as a ball as a ball of characters um but I'm going to show you
46:36
the video later so I'm going to have a ball of ask characters in on the HTML 5 canvas to show you the sing protocol
46:43
working via trident ruling ruling means the final ver means command and control
46:49
sequence. So there's no reason to vote here but you know you have to show that it works as so the have to resolve the
46:57
system. Again you have yx yx um yx um
47:03
row which should be uh the anything and most everything um ei should be minus
47:08
one - one e u minus one minus one left one one minus one um left
47:16
shift actually shift and minus one down which should be n and you have to see
47:22
all the rotate rotate and point to the n m which should mean n so that'll be the
47:27
end for nexus So we play O for Oscar, E for Bravo, I for India and N for
47:33
November. E for Echo X. Okay guys, thank you for watching and that's
47:39
exo. Exo the exo remembers the state of the current state of it's a stless
47:44
system that mean knows the state is still remembers what is done. It is
47:49
still remembers and does not forget and it doesn't forget. So um the next video
47:55
will be on the HTML file canvas. Um but what still pro still it's not stateless
48:00
yes but remember still state it's stateless doesn't mean it doesn't remember but it's a stateless it
48:06
remembers stuff it doesn't need to forget ever again so encodes that into the geometry of the system so you can
48:12
add new character set as as language evolves um thank you guys for watching this video uh have a lovely day my name
48:19
is and take care if you're joining
