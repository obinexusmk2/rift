
Okay. So, uh today's date is the uh 2nd of the February 26. Time now is
0:15
866 8:06 a.m. Uh let's continue with Odinist. Uh my implementation of this is
0:23
my calculator on. I got my phone here. Show my calculator.
0:29
should have let me do a calculator guys because if I don't have my calculator I
0:35
will not I will not start this video but you know I already got my calculator so
0:40
you know my pants so I just started so as you can see in the board today
0:55
my food is starting so uh train uh to try Trident uh heterogeneous homogeneous
1:02
chemical interpretation uh for district keyboard uh
1:09
uh what I say sense. So uh you know so you get um and
1:16
you get first of all this video is one of the most important videos I'll make on open sense. Open sense O for Oscar P
1:24
for papa O for Oscar P for papa E for Echo N for November S for Sarah E for
1:32
Echo N for November S for Sarah E for Echo is basically part of the OB um
1:38
initiative. So you have um you have open sense and you have open moral. O for
1:46
Oscar, P for Papa, E for Esco, Echo, N for November.
1:53
Uh uh uh M for Mike, O for Orange, T for Tango,
1:58
O for Oscar, O for Romeo, which is open sense initiative. But you know, it's basically um two two in one. Uh but
2:07
you're either open sense or open model. Uh you lose one of these categories. Um you know for now but you know pick your
2:14
poison pick what you want to do. Um so you get um hyper hyper uh people on the
2:20
hyper spectrum. Autism uh people are are hyper happiness. Why for Yankee B for Hyper E
2:27
for esco for Romeo hyper they are they are hypo. So just one two framework
2:34
hyper and hypo u hyper for yankee people for papa both
2:39
original. So you get two type of people uh that classifiers but um high power
2:44
people um uh just have used dimension of sensory information because you have to
2:50
observe the information around you before you can act on it. can do something like you know you have to um
2:55
you know you have to like um you have to um for example there's a pathway there um there's a pathway there's a
3:02
pathway every system has uh every real world
3:07
system with a x or z co system has an x y z up down left right and they have uh
3:16
uh they have two axises so they have a uh x pad forward backward
3:24
White House down. Good morning. I'm busy.
3:29
Get out of my way. Hi, Rich. How are you? I'm fine.
3:36
I'm really impressed. Sorry.
3:45
No, that's fine. You need to do that and then I'll come back and see it.
3:50
to you. Sorry. Thank you. Hi, Rachel. Sorry.
3:56
Uh, so you get uh forward uh forward backwards. No, forward backwards up down
4:03
and side to side or left right left or right to right side to side. So you get
4:09
those fragments. But what I'm saying to you N is you get this down two to one.
4:15
Um but the problem here is the people that seek out more info called hypo hypo
4:21
people seek more information from the system. So this is where they're touching something or something to find
4:27
more people. They have a threshold but I believe there's a baseline still. So how can I test from a baseline? So uh the
4:34
baseline is basically this problem they see a baseline of information and the baseline is
4:41
basically what determines the dimension you categorize in uh but this is a test about this. So open motor people people
4:49
that are open moto um just get on with it. You know, you have to give them a gadget and they say, "Oh, yes, this
4:55
perfectly works for me." That's the goal. It works perfectly. It works perfectly. So, the people there people
5:00
that are hyper and they mostly be open motor mostly
5:06
likely. They're more likely a motor. That means the the motor neuron takes to
5:11
go use daily. It doesn't matter if it's gone or a new writing equipment like a t
5:17
pen tablet. you have to then feel the pen tablet in every pathway the shape of the pen tablet and see whether um the um
5:26
um way to go. So you know um the hyper hyper hyper or hypo and hyper people
5:32
have this secret information people just get on with it they are they sensory um uh system they really know how to uh
5:40
it's more like they already know what information to process you know it's basically the hand eye condition hand
5:45
and eye condition for senses hand and eye coordination for senses um because
5:50
if the senses if you if you can't see you have to heighten your sense of sight by touch or by echo echolocation you say
5:58
the goal is literally um to have this very important trial model.
6:04
So the tri model is basically um what's happening
6:09
consensus you have the tri ruling T for tango R
6:15
for Romeo I for indigo D for delta E for echo N for member T for tango
6:21
ruling like a ruling like you know controlling commanding command and controlling. So the term ruling refers
6:26
to commanding and controlling. So command but people has to do it. So the computer has to give you a way to do
6:31
that thing and there has to be a way to do you get a way to do you get open
6:37
motor and you get open motor you get open sense uh people seek senses
6:45
you know given the computer give the tablet just get it so it's basically
6:51
computer respect your senses respect your senses you know depend on how your senses are you know how people just you
6:57
know have good information and have to seek less information uh and hyper people. So hyper people have to have all
7:04
the information already information and they have to seek less just get the class done and hyper people hyper people
7:10
are opposite. So the problem of this framework is that you know it's just a new framework. So it's actually
7:16
preesting but no one has better accessibility than obsess. Thank you guys. So you know this is a thought or
7:22
not if the holographic system does not have consensus holographic you're you're talking that's fake fake to you. So like
7:29
you know if I have a projection of a a train a train a train car a train step a
7:35
train or Lego step up to me I can touch it I can feel it I don't feel it's real
7:40
I will lose that information too. So the problem works both ways. It works both ways. The problem works both ways. So if
7:45
I have holographic train or holographic helicopter
7:57
back, I don't care. So you know on the floor it will literally make me less of a less of a problem because you know the
8:05
system around me already there has no cons. the whole system will work against me. Um so
8:12
naturally naturally and even the system will fail fail itself own. So the baseline of the metric has to be um
8:20
hyper and hypo a shared dimension of hyper and hyper. So I can say this before one hand my hand if I lose my
8:26
hand don't do anything of me it's a big dimension of me you know doesn't matter where I lose my hand my dreams you know
8:32
if I lose my hand my dream and um ex get shot in his dream and his hand his
8:39
hand you know that's his hand lost but get shot so the the you have three
8:44
dimensions you have you have bipolar I'm alive
8:50
and dead and And I can be in a superm super I can be
8:56
alive and dead. But this time this is what I am. You know the proof
9:04
lapis which is alpha love for laptop a for alpha p for papa i for s for lapis.
9:12
So you know me alive and dead that mean I have two and bipolar.
9:17
alive and dead and somewhere in between or somewhere else entirely you know show of dead this
9:25
trident. So the structure is basically deciding whether the mission is either a zero or one or you are dictating your
9:31
own super position which is a zero and a one you know based on the probability scale of whatever action you have you
9:38
know so it must not fail you but you know the trident here and now philosophy is basically um
9:47
of um interpretation. So we got the files which are symbolic interpreters and the symbol has to have
9:54
a meaning something you know and for that mean to have like must be um must be canized. So for
10:03
example uh channel channel OB is in channel zero channel zero which is on
10:09
channel one CH1 and SA is on CH2 I mean um OB okay. So basically this this is
10:17
channel this is channel framework. So uh we are if OB says uh if OB has so I'm
10:25
use alphabet because I'm going to use alphabet. So we have 26 characters in English alphabet. Uh so we have n minus
10:30
one index you have um you know so the they all share uh 26 characters 26
10:37
characters which is the English alphabet alphabet alphabet but they can say
10:42
different things you know they can say so how can I get a kind of confusion between a b and c you know and channel z
10:51
channel one ch0 channel 0 which is channel one which is channel and ch2
10:57
which is channel you know Because it's basically it basically works on the system of um you know chemicality you
11:04
know because you know if you if you have if you have validation in one of them you know there's no chemical
11:11
you don't share the soical partical analyzer but pass through the symbolic
11:18
expression so you know what are they trying to express and what do the intentions mean you know what are the intentions you know I can say I love you
11:25
I love you I love you that is not just I love you we don't share that you know
11:33
the way we share that actually is you love me you love me so if says I love you which replies you love me you love
11:42
me you love me this is a question and thank you is a question and statement so
11:47
then you get the punctuation so if you get you love me you get I love you and then you get uh what what will you say
11:55
okay and then this goes to say I love you. You love me. And then
12:01
you know he hears this message and then he says who loves who? Who
12:06
loves who? Who loves who? You know or who loves who? This question is
12:11
basically the the last question on the channel is like who loves who? So this question is a question
12:19
for mathematically you get three pointers to the data and the three pointers are the actual point of data.
12:27
This actually just character involved when you're asking a toz sequence you know of instruction. So a to is used
12:34
here because a to give you some expression that that means
12:41
something. So we just we just form a question here. You know this question is still posing for this is this is not
12:48
system. This has ambiguity. There's a question about who loves him and this question is what you know people
12:56
try to ple so you know because you get three interpretations of an expression
13:02
you have uh uh you have three interpretations of um part of three
13:07
meanings maybe so if the expression is um I love you I love you
13:14
I love you you love me you love me and then you know then The puzzle will be um
13:21
puzzle be whatever they share. So the pas is what plea will be the referial
13:28
the be what is there. So the puzzle will be um um uh I I maps to you
13:36
I I to you to I you know that so I is you you and I. There's no difference
13:42
only the channel. So the child comes a point of his own but it holds data and then who loves who who loves who will be
13:50
uh the the the the anchor of you get you get minus one pointer. So the goal is to
13:55
have three pointers minus one. So you get um three pointers that hold space
14:01
but you get zero that holds nothing. You get minus one which holds something but nothing. So it holds the memory
14:06
allocation. So you know it's basically if you get zero if you get value zero you get um epsilon but epsilon is
14:14
nothing nothing so to represent a one one you have to have a true value so
14:20
holding a true value is a negative pointer so it's memory that's not been allocated here so it's me allocated but
14:27
it's not being accum it's been um me allocated yes for a system but it's been
14:34
used you know the system computed ahead of time implicitly you That's okay. So for every
14:42
there's something that happens and you don't know it's happening but as it happens and this the thing holds memory
14:50
bite space you know but it's not just wait for other things to finish running using memory but the programs are
14:56
interdependent you know they're related so it works so and so I'm just this now
15:03
so we're going to go to the proof now but you know the minus one is just like
15:08
we have some space so it's not So we take a system here. We get uh XY
15:14
system which the tunnel goes down the middle. Yep. Middle here.
15:23
Uh so I'm I'm trying. So here it's basically research. So uh so I'm
15:30
one of my right and I'm going to take this channel.
15:36
So you get uh channel zero. I love you. You love me.
15:45
We should you love. Oh no. So I love you. You love me. So
15:52
that's wrong one. So you love me and u and then channel zero. Oh so wrong one.
15:58
So channel three will not be used. Channel three will not be used. So this
16:03
I love you, you love me. who love and then that's um basically the two
16:09
pointers sorry the two pointers um I was theorizing the two pointers channel 0
16:14
one resolve resolve resolve because I love you as you love me and those are
16:20
theological aspect of two pointers so you need two - one pointers 2 - one and
16:26
- one 2 - one pointers which are whole of space to resolve that system so you have to hold space ahead of time because
16:32
the calculator doesn't make sense so you have to hold um double the uh double the number. So if you have if you allocate
16:38
uh 26 characters 26
16:43
characters you have to allocate 26 * 26 for this whole message to result between
16:49
channel zero and channel one and that is I love you you love me now 3 is not being used but two can hold one or zero
16:58
zero uh zero to hold anything between two pointers so that's my point so I
17:03
love you you love me Who loves who? And he says who loves who? Uh do they love
17:09
each other? So who channel? So uh so so now one ch three would be Obie I
17:18
loves uh uh you know we love each other but
17:25
you know two people that work together you know so the point of resolves because you know there are two channels
17:31
and two only be used and you have to get those channel to use them. So you know uh so this video was basically not a
17:37
complete video but let me try completely. So you get heterogeneous homogeneous
17:43
fighting foration and you get obser have a keyboard sequence. So the
17:49
keyboard sequence is basically the your I'm trying to have a keyboard sequence
17:54
like actually um so let me just hypo
18:02
so let me just try to um so try to
18:09
you get hyper you get to here so you get so so you get um
18:17
keyboard so There's a pathway the pathway you can go and the shape you can go can take and the form you can take to
18:24
resolve a problem. Uh so the I'm going to I'm going introduce you guys to my lapis framework. My lapis alpha llama p
18:31
a for papa alph for llama a for alpha p for papa i for indigo s for sarah
18:39
and you say lapis. So you get this lap situation a disjoint key system. So you
18:44
get a disjoint keyboard system. What does that mean? So you know um the
18:50
problem is basically you get a keyboard and the keyboard is not going to give you the most random set of characters A
18:55
to Z A to Z ask the most random set of so you can make well I I argue this can
19:01
be on the computer you just you can use them so you have two main problems you
19:07
identify here the time and the time and space the time so the time capsule like
19:13
you know uh the time it takes to for you to move your hand between um Q keys you
19:18
know because you know the randomly by humans you know you know humans randomly but I'm extend the time so you know so
19:26
you don't people you know people can wear you know how fast you type so is a random keyboard you should stand but
19:34
it's not good enough to forget about the punctuation you know um just add a space
19:39
bar so you have a z and a space 27 characters
19:45
27 characters and space bar So the space bar is representing the seven criteria 27 between two channels uh um two two
19:54
receive three channels OBI 21 so you get 27 times so you get 27
20:03
so you get a total of 27 to the power of 3 which is 1,00
20:12
yeah 1,00 19 um 19,68 23
20:22
know so you get I'm going to have you understand how this work is going so
20:27
what I'm trying to do is basically determine how this works so you have a pathway a pathway a pathway a pathway
20:36
which is like um the pi over 4 pi over 3
20:42
pi over two and pi over one the pathway um the shape all the the shape of the
20:48
the shape of the structure the shape of the cube the pathway you take to get to objective so you have the path you get
20:55
to objective the type we're going to type you know so this means um two to
21:00
one mapping one to two
21:07
to one so um so you get a password you write down the terms I love you I love you so
21:14
we're going to use I love you I love you because I love That term now it's Jenz Jenz friendly and I'm a Jenz teacher so
21:19
I love that term myself anyway I love myself some oh I love myself let me say
21:25
I love myself I love me I love me I love me oh I love me oh yes I love me I love
21:33
the message here the message I love me myself and I so so uh basically it's
21:42
like an improve implicit proof implicit proof system because it's district. It's district but it's explicitly defined. So
21:49
implicit proof was defined. So that's the only dist
21:57
every path you take, every shape you have, every shape or structure
22:03
of the problem you encounter. um at every page shape of the problem
22:11
every page shape every way you go can resolve the system. So you know so you
22:17
get you get try them. So every pathway you take like you walk in the park up
22:22
down left right you know it doesn't matter uh you know you get six axis
22:28
total uh you get four a side to side but you get four axis you get up down and get
22:37
forward backwards and left and right forward backwards forward backwards
22:42
forward forward backwards left and right yeah so
22:49
your fingers to move forward backation to begin forward backwards up and down.
22:54
Oh, hello. You're here. How are you? Do you have time to choose your meals?
23:01
No, it's Yes. Um, mainly double portion.
23:07
Okay. So, for lunch, we've got vegetable portion. Okay.
23:13
I mean, extra portion. Thank you. So, you have six accesses. So you get so
23:19
you get uh up down I mean you get north east
23:25
no east southwest do you get no no
23:34
you get to the power three actually so you get no uh *
23:42
you get this power three this cube and you get sound cube and you get west cube
23:49
But they represent the dimensions for x you get you can have no time to n² no
23:56
square is a dimension in the second realm the second dimension and not be a forward backwards can be define um left
24:04
and right you know left and right you know but you can have something that's joint you know b action you want so you
24:10
want so the proof basically works like this node squ
24:15
e squ so you get n e square This is to the north
24:21
5° north east square. So that east square east you get east south uh but
24:30
the pol 4 / 4 to the power of 3. So that's
24:39
p / 4 pi pi / 4 to the power of 3 which is 0
24:49
uh 4 uh 8447 and you get uh uh for note is you get
24:56
times times by 3
25:02
times pi pi I
25:09
* oh time p /
25:19
by um oh * pi um * pi.
25:27
So let's use northwest um times pi um which is one. So you get oh hold on. So
25:34
you get let's do pi or pi / 4.
25:40
Let's do um pi / 4. Pi / 4 which is pi /
25:46
4 northeast southwest northwest times times oh this bally
25:52
north is this is west pointing this this bally the polar the compass pointing west west west west west west west west
25:57
west west west west west west west west west west west west west um is east is there west is there um times times p oh
26:04
no this what this is north okay divided by 4 is north so this is north is north
26:10
and north * pi * which is pi * * *
26:20
/ 1 which is 2 uh 6 2.4674
26:28
2.4674 so basically the area is 2.4674 uh but the dimensions basically have the
26:34
unit of 2.46740 46740. So now we have 360. Now 360 will give
26:40
you the units that they share in uh in radian. No in degrees in degrees. So
26:46
this will give you uh in radian. Oh um so bically this angle is basically um
26:52
times pi. Um but you have to do times pi. So you have to do pi the angle divided
26:58
by 180. So pi / 118 will give me divided
27:04
by 118 which give me degrees. That's what it gives me by 118 radians
27:11
will give me yes. So the angle uh so uh to me it will be facing
27:18
actually let me just do uh pi 3 pi * pi
27:24
pi * p / 3 instead. So let me do the one like pi * pi / 3 uh times pi
27:33
will give me uh 3.289 um 2.38 3.2.38
27:42
2.38 2.38 2.38 3 No 3.28 28 is pi is basically pi
27:53
uh pi / 1 or p p / 1 * /
28:00
3 and that will give me uh uh 3.2 if I divide by 180 I'll be dividing by um the
28:08
radian I'll be I have to times by have to do um angle in radian so this angle
28:15
3.2898 28 9866 we're giving angle in radian radium but
28:20
you know I don't want radium I want degrees so uh degrees will be uh
28:27
uh so two degrees so thisly um not given times 180
28:36
pi times um so
28:45
Um, let me do um 3.28
28:51
28 2°
28:58
S is uh Fahrenheit. No uh Celsius temperature uh uh uh area angle angle
29:06
angle angle radian radian radian radian degrees
29:12
uh radians. So the angle is in radian. So it's 180 188.4
29:19
uh I'm in radian mode. I mean um I mean I mean radio
29:25
I mean um so 3.28 2898°
29:30
is um to degrees um 3 um
29:39
so I haven't put in degrees so I'm using I'm using radian so basically the radian
29:45
is equivalent to uh 1888.4 4 uh.5
29:52
49 uh 492° 492° 188.492°
29:59
and this will give me um the angle um what is 88.492° and this will be enough
30:04
for me to compute the pathway. the area of the pathway. The pathway is extend.
30:10
So the pathway extends 188 um units in um degrees um but uh
30:18
divided by 2 pi say uh so this is the angle in degrees um this is pathway um
30:24
uh no no uh no wait no I'm not dumb no I'm not dumb no wrong so this angle here
30:31
is not complete so I have to do time 2 pi r * 2 pi r so I'll do divid by 180 if
30:38
I divide by 180 degrees it will be in um um uh uh so that be in radium. So so uh
30:46
so the number will be so it's not really yet. So uh so that pi / 180
30:55
oh times times so 3 I'm doing I'm not doing 3.2898 2898
31:01
times u time pi uh or time pi
31:09
* pi / by 180 which will give me the angle uh in
31:17
radians 0.057 057 419
31:23
and now this radian can be * 2 pi r so the radius is r but the radius is 180 so
31:32
180 is a part so I'll do 2 * 2 * uh * 2
31:38
* 180 uh will be 360 * 360 * 360
31:46
* 360 Okay. So, it will be 180 + 180
31:53
180 * 260.
31:59
Yeah. So, 180. So, that would be 180. So that will be 360 * 360
32:06
* 2 * * 360
32:11
* 260 will be 20 um 86878
32:18
* * pi was 2 pi r
32:26
and this will be 64° uh in perimeter. the perimeter will be
32:32
uh 64 units in perimeter or 64 um you know basically I have the pathway now so
32:39
this will be two possibilities you have uh so so basically I have to rotate rotate 64°
32:46
64.93 9 with my initial input of between um pi
32:55
pi pi pi over 1 and pi over 3 pi over 1 and pi over three uh two in angles.
33:03
She's one the four the four point 939
33:08
is the u uh 939 or 934 is the rotation
33:15
rotation of the polar get the polar rule. So you polar um um and so after
33:21
that displacement so so basically this is the angle I have to take. Now to get this place I have to use the same formula but I have to calculate the
33:27
units. So if I have um uh uh so so the first one is u
33:35
pathway. So let me continue. So the go what we to do now is to have the pathway destroying from the pathway shape the
33:42
shape and form. So know the shape of the structure that I need to advance you know you know so I have a two to one
33:49
mapping of the keyboard. So you know the keyboards have to be 64.939°
33:56
rotation of my fingers of my hands. So I can input via kinematics in so I can
34:03
input anything that's in front of me. So if my hands at the center of the keyboard which mean I have to rotate
34:09
only 64.939° any finger any any one of my fingers to
34:15
get to the next key up. So you have to have a random sequence and the random sequence is like you know if I move if I
34:21
move one if I move one right randomly if I take two uh two forward um uh uh two
34:31
two uh if I have two left walks two left top two left one two from Q one two uh
34:39
one two I should have a new random character you know D you know D you know but D is um not determined. So here so
34:47
so if I have a so if I have a a if I have a a A and um and then I and then I
34:55
shuffle and I shuffle a then I get um uh I get if I shuffle a I get I get I get
35:02
um B I get B. B is not allowed. C is not allowed. D is allowed but D is the worst
35:08
case the worst one I use. So I have to have A D next to D. Not A next to S. But
35:15
I can shuffle the inverse way too. I have a z yx. So I can have a uh a next
35:22
to I can have a next to zed and y you know I can have a next to x you know but
35:28
x is just one option I have. So you know cuz I have uh um or I can I can I can
35:34
then have this option. I can see the so I can have a uh uh a d or x. But if I
35:43
shift the axis again, I can have a next to d uh and that'll be random
35:51
enough to um shuffle. So you take the input character things on the that used to access and put it on the worst case
35:57
on the left side. So you get uh a so you get half of the alphabet. So you get 26
36:03
letters um divided by two which would be uh uh 13 13 but 13 letters on the left
36:11
on the left cuz people are left-handed. understand the easy stuff. So I can type my letters answer phone call any type of space at
36:18
the same time. So the goal is to have every pathway work on polar axis. So the polar means um um you have uh um uh you
36:26
you rotate then you move then you elevate you elevate you elevate mean you
36:31
so this is XYZ cooling system but for keyboard modeling because the keyboard is a threat when your life is in danger.
36:37
So you have every polar axis, every pathway, every path shape, you can take
36:44
the shape of the problem, the shape of the every pathway, every part shape or structure uh or substructure all the
36:51
same thing that that should not that should not that that should that should indict or disjoint latice. So you know
36:58
you have disjoint latises or of access of freedom destruct disint. So it's a
37:05
disjoint the freedom of your movement of hand. So you don't so so you can type less you know you have to take more time
37:11
to type but more time to type doesn't mean you can't make a call you can do your navigation. So the this framework
37:18
works because you get the angle but let's say you get this place um um 36 um um um how much is
37:26
your finger you get here five um 5 cm 5 cm um like you know this basically um 10
37:32
cm let's do let's do 15 cm uh so you get 15 cm so you have the angle again
37:41
4.93 of your left hand rotation and you get um and you get this is 15 uh cm
37:49
uh cm um let's say uh 12.5 cm 12.5 cm
37:54
away from my skin. You have to you have to be able to calculate that keyboard too know where the key is you know so
38:01
you can indicate so the key 25.5 cmters away from 65 to 4.983 degrees has to be
38:09
known this one this is how to shuffle so you have two every two keyboard shuffle so you have the left keyboard you know
38:15
where every key is but appear is random it's a random generator so the two to one mapping is basically if I have two
38:22
two random inputs two pathway I one if I have two left, I have one right turn. If
38:29
I have uh um two two left, I have one right turn. If I have two up, two ups, I
38:35
have one down turn, one down movement. If I have uh one left, one left, I have two right. If that's one to two, you
38:41
see, but you know, it's basically to show randomness. You know, you shuffle via the sequence and the sequence is
38:47
random because the number or the computation sequence allows you to determine the first decision. So you
38:52
have 64 uh 64.95 12.5 cm of displacement and elevation
38:59
which means how how much your how much your fingers press down on keys how much
39:05
keyboard elevation is really important for vows. So as a poly we elevate all
39:10
the all the vows of e philosophy. So a e i o u the six vows we have six vows in
39:16
ibo they're tonal they have we have tonal vows. So we have six vowels um and
39:21
uh uh 34 consonants I believe. So all the vowels should be elevated
39:27
because they let you breathe you know. So the goal is to have the the keyboard respect you uh every part should avoid
39:34
but you know it's a disjoint dexterity allows you to move freely uh without getting get pressing the wrong keys you
39:41
know uh disjoint dexterity model for pressing the right keys and sending the right messages to the trident access
39:47
pointers. Thank you guys for watching um uh these videos. Now let me just show you my work on the board. Um so the
39:54
elevation will be the height. What will be the height? Base times height. The height will be So you get width time
39:59
height. Um base you get base times height. But the base time you get the base uh which is basically you get you
40:05
get the base. You get the width times the height which is um one base. One base. So it's the base time. So the base
40:12
the base of the keyboard. you get half of that uh you get um times two two bases equals one height you know and
40:18
that's elevation parameter. The elevation is basically um to get half time base time height
40:25
half time half time width time height or half time base half time base which will
40:32
give you when the keyboard is down keyboard down keyboard down because the half times base means that half if you
40:38
have one full base you have width time height squared and that will be if this if the
40:46
keyboard is up uh up and it's elevated. The elevation has determined a e i o u
40:52
and the and the vowels and the and the 12 consonants um that are most used
40:58
frequently in Hebrew philosology. So you know uh uh okay guys peace, take care.
41:03
Love you guys. I got to have something done to me today. Uh but I have a lot to do um uh uh uh for now. uh take this
41:12
video and um try to if you can nam guys try to complete the the part the shape
41:17
the part every pathway shape and form uh the form of the problem form of the structure you know uh try to give the
41:24
the so the form will be um you get a structure you get structure which is
41:29
structure I'm referring to uh that heterogeneous homogeneous uh and you get the shape of the structure which is
41:35
substructure so shape is a substructure and you have one more thing you have the pathway shape and form and the form form
41:41
of the problem the formal disjoint form I'm referring of the geometry of the system via lapis integrals um alpha
41:48
alpha if alpha alpha alpha alpha lima if alpha p for
41:54
