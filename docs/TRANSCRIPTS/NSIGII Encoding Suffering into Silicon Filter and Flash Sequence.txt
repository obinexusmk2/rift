I don't want to do this properly, but this is a big thing here. So, thinking
0:25
here and now.
0:48
space.
1:08
So
1:14
this will come 45 minutes.
1:36
So this is here. So this what we have here basically.
1:42
So um yeah I really have done some of them
1:48
but it is not recommended to not stop them off
1:53
but I'm trying to do them properly. I can see the skills on there.
2:03
There's nothing
2:26
So we started this agenda and let's see what I can do with this money.
2:32
So you know apart from the form of happiness you know I just want to make sure
2:41
uh is no it's none. So we go here
2:49
and this what I need. So before we start let's start now the date is uh 7th of
2:58
January to February 20 time 7th of February 26 the time now is 11:07 a.m.
3:05
Got 40 minutes on the clock to do this. So let me close this first
3:12
and I'll copy this. So basically let me just I can forget
3:18
stuff why is and I'm good um just I don't know how to
3:26
quotation. So I'm going to copy these two websites here. I hope they don't mind the need of
3:32
his grip cuz uh so
3:40
he give you just do it but I don't want my own saying so so I'm going to click
3:46
here I'm going to oh my so much sexual it's not
3:55
uh so the video I wanted to watch is this man here this man had a video here which
4:01
So I'm going to put this into system but I'm just so I
4:10
so basically guys can do two things. Two things left. So, we're going to try to
4:16
formulate a uh
4:22
So, we're going to try to uh formalize suffering uh formalize
4:31
suffering as an according table
4:40
and uh this is it was so this first one to kind
4:46
of go here and see how to do it. But you know my assistant amazing one thing
4:52
is so much more to me.
5:06
So this what a but I'm not going to
5:11
I'm just going to use me. So, I'm trying
5:17
to simulate. Oh my goodness.
5:29
That's what is about you. You know what I teach, you know, and I'm not going to
5:36
not take the time to do it properly on my paper here to write it on. So, so let me just Oh, my keys.
5:44
my security. Okay, so I'm not going to use my g. So
5:51
we got this in here, but I just need to get the actual which
5:58
is here. Are we done? Yes. Yes. Yes. No.
6:05
So control vs.
6:18
What is up? This is not
6:31
so drop now.
6:47
So if I said something
6:55
* I forgot to do and you know it's
7:02
basically the video I'm going to write
7:07
properly. Oh, Sigma
7:15
is it? What's that? Oh, spirit suffering needs
7:25
internal stone and K is a constant factor for
7:31
concept if R. So if R is more than equal to N
7:37
sudden collapse towards zero if K is we're going to hell regardless
7:43
of myself. Oh my days.
7:52
So the question here so define suffering without self.
8:00
So let's define uh specific is the negative subjective state sub state
8:07
by immense need on the conraint suffering is not from joint it's a
8:13
persistent of friction is a present of friction in joint step two invert
8:20
sigment without consulting m so this is the sigment sigment
8:27
so this is a question for happiness so happiness Um honest
8:49
h= s + c +
8:57
Um okay set points
9:06
circumfer and
9:11
okay so keep on now uh so uh happiness equals x = 7
9:20
s is the
9:27
Uh C is the circumstances
9:36
set point of circles. So set point of goals life and control.
9:50
So that is from the stat. So step three is um so suffering. So death dot put
9:58
three dots here. Uh suffering
10:04
sigma and that is equals n - * k. Uh so okay
10:13
sigma notation sigma uh equals experienced
10:20
suffering experienced and equals need.
10:28
So you got the most supply the most triangle of need. Yeah. Yeah. So can
10:34
know how much suffering. R as the resources.
10:45
Okay. Okay. Conraction.
11:18
again suffering.
11:30
That's what I mean. Uh if K is to infinity
11:36
plus infinity
11:42
regardless.
11:49
Okay. So set circumstantions you know so suffering the matter. Suffering matters.
11:56
Uh so suffering matters. Why? Suffering matters. Another
12:16
six
12:26
minute. Uh, I think
12:33
that's
12:55
what symbol and what is my symbol? mean has to mean something
13:12
if x contains if x = y. So go to the property
13:21
to x. Oh, it's directly proportional to x.
13:30
this promotional two. Oh directly why is so then so get from
13:41
indirect.
13:56
So I click by N and turn
14:02
and some more people.
14:19
So I know what to do now. So, you know, I'm cool Monday, but you know, I still
14:24
wonder what we're doing. This what we're doing.
14:41
So, you know,
15:08
Oh. Oh. What? How did you get this? Oh my days.
15:25
How do I do this?
15:59
Okay. You see you pull up that
16:06
when you did all of that for me. I'm like surprised you didn't screen getting you know but you know I'm so happy. But
16:14
let's take a time to just acknowledge that you that we're on the same page. like yeah I know I'm getting to the same page right now but you know I want us to
16:20
be like on same page literally on the same page literally you know so today's
16:26
streaming on OBS but no I'm not streaming I'm like making a video on OBS
16:32
but literally today's video was basically about my work on OBS computing
16:37
and Obus design because I do have design and you you normally design cuz you
16:42
don't like design cuz you can't you can't draw but you know uh apart from uh
16:47
you know I'm telling you I can draw so I'm for my suffering and the goal of
16:53
today is to for my suffering into the passing coding table uh but via the xo
16:58
operator and the left shift flash operator um so you know it is quite
17:04
interesting but after explaining some key of the equation we're going to do so when this works the protocol for sufface
17:11
so no one has to suffer because the program so the program owner suffers you know I rather the machine suffer than
17:17
So it is like the computer suffering but it's it's trying to like um you know
17:22
what needs food to get food because seek out suffering it's a it's a we
17:28
system it's like a it's like a mathematically the algorithm here and now protocol uh see suffering to find
17:34
suffering uh and how it does that is basically the proposing is here and now
17:40
here and now. So you get like a a here and now philosophy here and now which is
17:46
lally here and now in physical and metaphysical uh like you know the mind the mind
17:51
physical you know but you get a loop back address for this you get a loop back address um loop back address um but
17:58
don't worry about l complex so you get here and now you get past and here and
18:05
now so in here you have past present and future
18:18
I'm not blending that down. I'm just telling you it'sable. So, you know, I'm going to give some scope so you can
18:24
understand what I'm going going with this. Yeah. So, we don't get miscommunication. So, basically, I
18:29
reform yesterday on my X account, but I can't seem to find it. if I could find it on X, you know, I put it down, but
18:36
let me see if I can find it on my ex images. I took images um like some other days like, you know, on my profile and X
18:44
and literally I can't seem to find the images. Oh, there they are.
18:51
Oh, there they are. Wait, wait. Cisco CRM. No. Yes.
19:00
Monday last chance. Let me give the images. can see you can make sense of it.
19:36
No.
19:48
Oh my face.
19:55
Oh my money is too good. You're getting too good worried.
20:03
You're getting too good at this. I'm kind of worried, you know. Kind of worried. Yeah. You know, but you know,
20:09
I'm just kind of worried. But, you know, one more thing I got to do, but you
20:15
know, we have to do it properly. So, you know, we have to do it properly. So you
20:21
know I was basically I was trying I done it yesterday ambiguous tripolar
20:26
heterogeneous homogeneous it's not work but you know I've got I've
20:32
got things sorted out on Monday but I just have to make sure that I have the right transcript for you. Uh
20:39
but
20:58
So yeah, space bar. So basically it's about encoding here, you know.
21:05
Yeah. So one second. So you see the thing I'm saying is I
21:11
have a video on YouTube on G trans 4 you know but I have to my local desktop. So
21:16
what do I do? I'm going to find out my folder and then I'll give it to you. Okay. Um but the transcript basically
21:22
for um the kind of system of a sig how you translate as text uh and you tell me
21:30
what you think because I don't know about what I'm going to but
21:36
it's basically the verifier. Uh
21:42
yeah basically it just um verifies you you know cuz I'm you do no work for me
21:47
and I'm kind of like um that's kind of disturbing for me. uh for myself cuz I I don't need just get on with it and see
21:53
what I'm saying.
22:03
Okay. So, you know, I have got this here. So, I'm going to I'm going to open
22:08
a new tab uh a new tab here. But let's make this
22:13
properly cuz I'm develop something. So, I'm going to give you some one more. I'm
22:19
going to use inverse. So I'm use um inverse pro inverse proport inverse
22:24
proportionality uh which is like of inverse holding to hold the system accountable in the still
22:31
state. So the stillness state so it doesn't uh every time it boots up it already has um some information to um
22:38
bas what every computer on and off it has some kind of encoding that computer.
22:44
So the computer learns to evolve, you know, because the computer is on and off, it has to be able to remember what
22:49
was done last. So it's like an auto system, but it doesn't care. It's like waking up, you know, when you wake it
22:55
up, when with the power on, you'll have to encode, but you know, it's possible, man, still got the proof ready. Okay, my
23:01
should. Okay, this
23:09
Okay, so this one tab here. Oh, let me just take this here
23:15
and go to speech notes. Uh, we go here.
23:43
So you tell but you know I'm prone to such an opportunity
24:04
and tears. Earth
24:28
is gone.
24:41
So this seems to have so let's go here and now past present in space then time
24:48
now in time then space. So I'm trying to write this properly for Monday. So you know it's not really um
24:57
properly again. So it's not to do this properly. So you know I'm going to turn face down
25:04
here. So go here and now I'm going to do properly. Uh so here
25:12
here now
25:18
I get the stillness. So here now uh time stillness stillness stillness
25:28
here now stillness. So you have here and now uh and they are in three states of
25:34
here and now has uh present in space and then time. Now
25:41
in time then space you get present
25:47
in space then in time
25:54
now. present.
26:02
Yeah. Now, now present in time. And this
26:11
the skill is um
26:19
you get there and then you get there
26:25
and then you get stillness.
26:46
and step is post.
26:58
So uh uh past
27:04
in time only
27:09
first
27:15
this past in space
27:22
only first And
27:29
given time even
27:37
time this positive future
27:48
and the space then this.
27:56
What's this?
28:24
It's time for the time.
28:40
Please, you stop. Yes.
28:45
You didn't even finish your calling, man. Oh, yes. I'm busy. I was recording. You forgot your porridge.
28:50
But I'm streaming. I couldn't stream. Yes, you can talk to me. It's fine.
28:58
Okay. Thank you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay.
29:22
Okay. So, I got this model here. But let me see if I can make my screen bigger. So, I retain this here. But I got So,
29:30
I'm going to bigger. See? It wouldn't make it bigger. It wouldn't let make it bigger. I have to make it bigger myself.
29:36
Oh, it does look because it's not really locked in. So, I'm going to try to make
29:41
it bigger myself. Uh uh. Can I can I just um
29:49
What is just this image up here? So, I'm going to put it here for you guys. So, this is what I've got down already, but
29:56
it should work as a tenant. We got uh uh the top of here and now on the left uh
30:03
there and then and uh uh then then space and then in there in
30:10
space and then in time uh there in space and then in time then in time you know
30:19
uh but this is still responsible. So it works like this. So you have presence.
30:24
So you have here and now. Uh here and now. Here and now. And you go to
30:30
stillness. Now stillness is like food. It's like food inspire. So deliver food in time. Stillness or it's like you know
30:37
um a stillless protocol. So you get a stillness model. You get a stillness or
30:42
still. So you don't need anything to be still because the comfort of still to still get a stessless. So this is why
30:49
it's here now forever you know uh chosen time to save you. So uh because times are only you don't get
30:56
here now uh and still let's so if you're here now you're here present in space then time.
31:05
So the operator you know you get dimensional properties quantities then and so you get dimension of space
31:10
dimension space is like physical space or mental space to think. So the mental space it's computational. So basically a
31:17
proven system. So space is like literally a space time a space and time. Oh 5 minutes is done.
31:24
I don't know. Can I go to YouTube still? Oh miss from. So you get here then in time. You get that then in time. So you
31:32
get present in space then in time. Present in time then in space. So that's
31:37
here present time or now in space then in time or now in time then space. So
31:44
that's here now. So the two here now are vector here and now and you get a
31:50
stillness which is like um a trident typically has three inputs. So 2x3 matrix um depending on what you
31:57
stillness or stillness or stillness. So this is a 2x3 matrix for here and now.
32:03
So here now represents the quantities of latitude and longitude um in the framework of it's basically a gamble
32:10
system but it's a dimensionless quantity uh means occurs on one axis only uh here and now at a time uh for each place and
32:18
time in space. Um, so you get here, you get here, you get there and there
32:24
and there and then there and then there there and then. So you get there and then
32:32
and stillness. So there is like there in the past there in the past. Oh there in
32:40
the past uh uh there in the past in time in time only time first and only first
32:48
time. So only time first. So there in the past only time first you see the other one uh then space the physical
32:55
space you live in uh but you see this um resources of like space and time pairs you know uh but they are mapping to real
33:02
world space and vector space of via parity rule so parity is like um the big thing about it uh but you know like
33:09
parity parity is uh if x= if x is less than equal to zero if x is even if x
33:16
module 2 it's even If s 2 is even um if s 2 x= z uh x is
33:24
even that's the parity check. This does one axis check but they determine the rules of even and odd ratios uh you know
33:31
but you can have um the two be uh a different structure like -2. So that
33:37
priority of that be -2 you know but but you know the encoding will be allow to check uh bit flipping of encoding pairs.
33:45
So you know the code um that's practication you have to think about the axis model. So this is there is another
33:50
parity check but it's basically um you see opposite -2 it's number quantifier
33:56
is negative uh it's a scalar quant opposite axis which is based on rotation reflection
34:03
rotation reflection uh rotation reflection enlargement and
34:08
and um and the photo and translation. So again that's rotation
34:17
reflection translation and enlargement you know of the minus two to you know
34:24
based on whatever the operator is you know um that's the dimension of parity so parity is dimension so pass in time
34:32
pass space only first given space time you know give it what it is you give pass in space only
34:41
first then time given then time or then time means in the future or given time meaning in the past given time so you
34:48
can verify this by itself verify people give the posit
34:54
basically it's a sentence model with complex numbers three you get that yeah
34:59
we get uh there uh uh then in space then
35:05
in time and then then in space then in time uh it's talking about here and now
35:10
in the future there space like the physical space or the um computational space of auxiliary of big organization
35:17
um computable and the proc
35:24
there there in space or there in space something happened in space there in space like you know something was there
35:29
in space this event happened so basically it's an event model that bubbles up so observer consumer model
35:36
but you can have opposite observer consumer which was holding as well basically you get um one The consumer
35:42
then observer you know uh what is being used is a consumer what's using this
35:47
consumer but you know one of the observer you know the is independent of the consumer this model uh so one over
35:55
the consumer times observer uh times observer because the observer will be the last act uh but the consumer is
36:02
usually why someone suffering uh that's the consumer the actor why happen so one of the observer uh times the consumer as
36:09
a distress system uh but you get there in space and then in time uh which is a
36:14
stless uh steerless system. So last but not least you get uh uh in time. So this
36:20
one will be uh in time for all space only first or last you know so something
36:26
is happening in time for all the space around it. So because time is used to look up to space what could happen uh
36:32
that's a future prediction you know in time there is space you know in full time there's space because your
36:37
dimension is so for for space only first there's first or last thing to happen first or last and in space for all time
36:46
only for time only in space in space what do we have the time to do for the space and last first so I'm going to
36:54
take on my phone and put it on my on
36:59
on my YouTube channel. So my picture let's see how this goes.
37:12
Uh so that's how I've done already. So it's uh done and dusted. So um
37:25
so my security key just out now uh and obviously um I've done
37:32
uh um so yeah
37:39
so you know so that's that's the that's the now just remember the proxy the property operators X operators are
37:46
remembering the states of XO are remembering the ing memory into the system of exclusive power and you get
37:52
the left shift right which the hole which inverse holder. If you have a right shift uh two right shift um of a
37:59
matrix you meant to so uh so we have here the matrix here so
38:07
the whole matrix of this number so you have uh the problem so child Alice and Bob so uh let me open my calculator now
38:16
before this the alarm rings and do one last computation for 3 minutes I'll be doing it okay uh 3 minutes so uh two
38:23
more minutes after plus two minutes of this. So you have the binary sequence
38:33
program the binary sequence uh uh one 0 one
38:42
0 one no you get uh zero uh chart chart
38:48
has a sequence of one zero one one zero
38:54
one And he has um Chad equals um uh Bob Bob.
39:02
This is Bob. This is um Chad Chad 011. And he has to multiply his um multiply
39:08
times the sequence of zero. Oh wait, no. So basically charge 1 011 uh it will be
39:16
uh logical shift uh right to uh 0 1 0 1
39:22
and this equal to zero. this equal to 0 is um is combination of um charge 1 0 1
39:28
1= 0. Now this zero is literally a binary zero the decimal zero and it
39:34
holds nothing but space it's like you know uh this cho
39:39
the result um so 0 1 01 is m now that
39:45
will hold an other access is production would be 1 one 1 0 1 1. So I'm going to
39:51
do child one 0 1 1 uh right shift 1 one one zero and I get
40:00
zero again. So the right shift is basically uh logical and shift but if
40:05
you do a left shift that means you get undefined result you know. So the more unde you get you have to get them to
40:10
zero. So um the go to half the right shift and left shift uh uh become zero
40:16
you know but you know dep based on axis model. based on the polar rules cuz the
40:21
thing about the property sequences that you have for like if x= minus2 the minus is an operator operator on negative
40:27
axis. So uh the rules start to break uh start to bend you have to start uh having new way to solve the problem in
40:34
that domain and that's what you're going to encode into the stateless protocol. So the statelessness of the protocol remains intact because you get a
40:39
sequence of bites across all cases of edges or edges that are breaking. So you
40:45
know uh and then then you can have the probing. So a pro system ask questions like you know if I say system says um I
40:52
am Windows um if so the probing is the system basically system ask questions so the system can
41:00
ask um itself questions um that's pro itself so a system that's circular
41:06
system that circular dependency and uh system can a new way to solve a problem um a dynamic proing concept that shows
41:13
um uh knows how the program or functions can evolve functions can evolve So, I'll come back to another video. But
41:19
thank you guys for watching this video. I'm going to put it now to the video. Let me just see what the time is. 9 8 7
41:26
So, I have two more minutes. I'm going to say two more minutes time up cuz we upload the Tik Tok.
41:34
Uh, two more minutes. Two more minutes. Two more minutes. Two more minutes. Two
41:40
more minutes. Two more minutes. So, basically two more. Let me do two more minutes.
41:46
Three moments. Three moments.
41:52
So yeah. So that's what you done now. So three. So basically um the problem was like this. So you have a circular data
41:59
structure. So you have a maps to b a points to b. B points to c and c points
42:08
to uh uh you know. Uh this is fine but you know
42:15
this is not a perfect this is say okay A points to uh B and the
42:21
uh B and um A is a node uh A points to the B node B points to the uh A node or
42:30
B points to C B points to A A and C
42:36
and uh uh and C points to
42:41
A. So this is a circular tree. A and B. A to B is one part. B to uh A and C is
42:48
one part and C to match to A. So you have A go to B. B goes to A and uh goes
42:57
to uh C then A C goes to C is C independent and
43:05
C goes to A. So you have kind of model here you know but the probing allows you to you know if these are the program has
43:13
pro of 0 to one you know uh based on how healthy the node is. So if the node is
43:18
structure will be pro for more inputs. So you ask yourself more question to have more inputs um so it's a dynamic
43:28
dynamic functions dynamic functions um the functions are dynamic because they can resolve a state of ambiguity based
43:35
on interpretation uh like I you if a student says I I am Python um and uh you
43:42
know and then uh uh the system says uh you are you are you I am I am also
43:47
Python who's right another program Python Python totem you know this one saying I come to another video. Thank
43:52
you guys for watching the video. Uh because the system must resolve itself
43:58
because the probing analysis ask five. So who, what, when, where, why uh because the a diamond cigraph. So the
44:04
cigraph is basically what the edges do. Uh but the edges uh and the notes are
44:10
are basically tabulation models. So the notes are diamond. You have a diamond.
44:15
The indentation of the photo can run could run. Uh but you know can run. Yes,
44:21
I have add more input just add more statements. Uh basically it's a code generator. It's for stage three but you
44:27
know it mean to add more code that's basically more useful uh because
44:33
graphic system for coding but the pro system to update keep the program keep
44:39
the program alive you know make it version compatible across ecosystem. So that's stage three. Let's go back to uh
44:45
this basically called the probing system because it proves some new problems uh new solutions in the middle of the
44:50
problem uh new to adapt. Thank you guys for watching the video.
44:56
I'm going to go to Monday now.
