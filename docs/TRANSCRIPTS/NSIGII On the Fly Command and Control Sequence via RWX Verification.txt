
Oh my. So yeah. So this video is um the CB uh command
0:09
control on the fly uh on the fly uh read
0:14
read write and execute um verification. Um
0:20
yeah so uh the world's first human rights protocol by me daming hopefully goes
0:26
viral anyway. Um for S for Sarah I for Indigo G for golf for golf I for India
0:38
oper
0:47
command and control as in control and command just controlling stuff and commanding scope sig is a scripting
0:53
system but it's basically scripting that that removes Google. So verifies the
1:00
paperwork. They give you houses. Well, gives you houses where you need houses. Nobody want houses. So
1:07
um scripted think of s
1:13
for France expressation.
1:21
Do I want house? Do I need house? Should I should I should I do I want a
1:28
house? Do I need a house? Um um do I want a house? A question of
1:35
ambiguity. Do I want or need? Could I instead of asking for house, do I want a
1:42
house? Yes or no? Uh do I need a house? Yes or no? Uh uh.
1:51
And there may be one um should I get a house?
1:56
Yes or no? Uh these questions are what consensus is based on via the principle
2:02
of a on the fly verification resolve in time ahead of time uh in
2:08
time. So if I give you a one, you give me a zero. Uh but do we have consensus
2:13
in the middle? Can we always agree on that we need as foundation? That's what C verify is
2:20
doing. It's verifying do I need a house? Do I want a house? Should I buy a house?
2:26
These two questions concern to yes no and maybe yes no and maybe no it's a
2:34
question answer system but it's a simple question for the foundation via principle the dimension of principle
2:39
build the principal principles of dimensions of the questions and shared [laughter] heristic problems they solve
2:46
via repair and renew build and break and um
2:53
uh create and destroy um in is a human system used to automate
2:59
stuffing system. Yes, to um allow you to
3:07
see it's an on the fly scripting system. Um a scripting system that allows you to
3:14
automate the things you don't need to do like paperwork to issue someone houses like me. Um but that's good. It's a
3:21
scripting system. It's a screening system that that runs that hold the
3:26
memory that the chain holds space for allocation for things
3:31
that needed not uh before you can get the want to get together need
3:41
the principles of dimensions that all dimensions said left right up down or
3:46
center whether the center will agree with the center based on the rules defined in the framework of
3:53
logistic the frame of the framework of consensus non flexible polar consensus
4:02
um to give you structure of syntax what is the meaning of love what is the
4:08
mean of hate what's the meaning of um orthological system so let's get started
4:17
So uh what you see my board the board has uh uh three systems read
4:26
write execute and we got I'm making a read execution table here
4:33
via the framework of R um R read R for read uh W for right
4:39
um this is a Cisco order model of the system
4:45
Cisco works here and verify. So system means left bottom up to you get two type
4:52
of system bottom system and top down system. So bottom of Cisco will be uh
4:58
this one uh left left node root node
5:04
left left uh uh root left right and
5:10
that's what all the persons agree on root left right this a self tree you see
5:16
[clears throat] in the so r x if my read is your right we have read
5:23
write execution schema A hand following poem. Read then write
5:29
then execute. Read then write then execute. Then we have read write. We
5:36
have write then execute then read. Right then execute then read. Then we have the
5:42
last one. Uh execute write and then read. Um execute write and then read. Um
5:50
this ratio of computation. These are three matrices that you should never code the system for the system uh to
5:58
execute in order of any order there is you know. So the mat again will be
6:04
R W X W R X and X R and X W
6:16
R. Now this table is a lookup table too. Uh because you have
6:23
uh a shared read uh read mode and a shared um uh one read
6:30
one three read and one right start from [clears throat] read you have angular read. So you have 0 0 as a read one one
6:39
and two two as a read you can areas two. So if you if you need
6:46
an area of um of index one uh of x x and
6:52
then y x y don't need the other ones.
6:58
So you get xx rewrite you get x x here. So execute means um uh
7:05
run execution execute uh read
7:10
we have as you see we have uh um R22 not equal to R22 is read read
7:19
and we have command read read
7:27
W uh you have read then write then execute you have rice then read then execute
7:33
It depends on what you need but you can have execute
7:39
execute you have the main one for reading. So I'm going to use this one for reading and writing and going
7:46
execute. So this is just read. So the uh writing mode will be if I want to write
7:51
then execute as start from right. So right to be uh w
7:57
um w u w uh w uh uh
8:06
so uh w write
8:13
to read execute if you want to execute. So if you want to read execute to a read
8:20
and a right. So two reads one read and one right [clears throat] here
8:26
right. So right execute read.
8:31
So right execute right
8:37
um right execute.
8:46
Right. This kilos
8:52
kilos attitude right
9:01
we have
9:09
as you can see I consider the matrix here all I can see basically so you get
9:15
Right, execute and read and you get read, write and execute. But
9:21
at the angles they we share a read and a right you know at the diagonals we have
9:27
right right and this are writing means um uh uh writing to some kind of system
9:33
while it's operating and you get read read now we have to have a Cisco model
9:40
of the cell tree that can give us read read and write right in this kind of
9:45
framework of polarity as dimensions not as the values literally but as a space for the vehicle
9:52
So we only want to write have a R w but we can have an X as well. So the X will
9:58
be let me just make the X as well because you know that makes sense. So the execution order will be um so if I'm
10:05
reading them right this is one this is one two execution order. So this is two
10:11
execute. So we need the right execute. The execute will be
10:17
uh uh execute then we write execute
10:29
uh execute the way execute right.
10:39
Yes, execute then write then read. She also want to end with the reading or the
10:44
writing and that's one. So execute read and write and read right or read.
10:53
Oh yes. So basically the following will be sorry execute will be uh
11:00
execute execute then write and read execute uh execute then read.
11:11
So execute them execute then write and then execute then read.
11:21
Oh, read execute.
11:31
We execute the Y
11:37
get X here. We write X. So we have three table of
11:44
consensus we can formalize. Now mathematically this is basically the consensus matrix.
11:50
So we have uh um um uh read write execute on the left on the root uh left
11:58
again we have uh write read and then execute on the left node of the string
12:05
node and because a tree it's not t for tango r for roia i for indigo and e for echo and x but you have to try to form a
12:13
tree a tree that's basically in parallel and it's this joint tree form world so
12:18
you know So the indexing will be isomeorphic to some of state of the system system here in we have the
12:26
command to execute while system is uh which run and this is where the bottom up
12:32
pausing comes in we try to determine how to rotate the tray uh Cisco tray to have
12:39
an execution order of uh something as some ascent that will be sent over the
12:45
time of integral. So that's the problem there. So and how the problem how we solve solve is basically a calculator.
12:53
So we have write SQ execute right frame and then read write SQ
13:01
and then we have we have execute right frame read execute
13:08
right and write execute uh write right
13:13
uh right read execute uh as you can see accesses.
13:19
So if these are access where does the where does the trade come in? When does the trade become uh
13:26
interdependent of the execute? What does it mean to have a shared concept tripolar system? When do we agree with
13:33
something execute? Because you know for when we execute is basically um when we
13:39
agree on the um execute flag what the execute flag is and that how we do this
13:45
is this. So we get a 1 2 3
14:02
right then Write um write.
14:23
So the problem here is this kind of problem. So we need to find execute a map read.
14:30
Right. So the map will be um how many reads? How many reads [clears throat] make one right? So you have look table
14:38
now. So how many reads makes one right? So so this house we have two reads to
14:45
one or two reads. So we have a table here.
14:53
Um um so we have two rings.
15:01
Two rings. Two rings of R R
15:08
two R two out one right. Two readings to make one.
15:13
Uh and then two reads to make one right.
15:21
One observation one two R.
15:27
So it turns out that 1 / 2 R is basically the convert of three and this
15:34
will give you execution order. So this you have to have the system the whole unit with two read operations which is
15:41
one filter one flash to send to execute the method.
15:48
So for every for for every two region how are the program state demographic
15:55
state that is equal to later time
16:01
later. Thank you. So for every two for every two reads you have you have one
16:09
right one implicit one implicit um uh
16:14
one one explicit right operation to do. This exclusive right is a reflection of the system filter and flash sequences.
16:21
So the filter represents sorting of the system but the flash is the sequence of
16:26
flash. So um the flash will be the sending of the message or the command
16:31
and the control system like um actually give. So the one read two read equals to one
16:38
right we have a whole message sent the whole message if the can be sent one
16:44
whole unit of the message that should be uh um um 256 um um one whole unit of the
16:54
message will be 52 bytes over 2 seconds. Uh that would be 52 seconds. 512 bytes
17:03
over two seconds is one 512 bytes of memory
17:10
um per read per two read operations per which is one execute operation.
17:17
Um two RR two reads make a right. Two rights make
17:22
an execute. Two two reads make one.
17:29
All right. Two reads.
17:38
Yes. Two reads and then to one right operation. Basically uh two two reads
17:44
bottom two reads at the bottom make one right. No one right one read is a right.
17:49
But two right two two reads makes one equation. the tree has to balance itself
17:54
out and that's going. So 525 bytes of data is um just a difficult back of data
18:00
per two seconds. So two reads will be um two R to one right as you can see here
18:07
you get to get one two so you get um write execute and read and you get um um
18:13
exe right then read execute and read you get um two hops. You get two hops from
18:20
one hop from read to um read to left
18:25
root right. One hop um one hop from um the um the the one hop from
18:35
the right node. uh which is read um one hop from the
18:41
right node uh of the right node which is one hop from the right node which is uh
18:47
read uh to the left node which is um read um root root left right
18:55
which is right which which one from right and you get execution. So uh and you have from the sq flag you have two
19:02
hops two hops you get um two hops that be uh
19:07
right read readers right and then um uh one left so you have two hops two hops
19:14
two hops uh left two hops uh left to execute and
19:24
those two hop have uh if you're if I'm writing depending on the state I am in so
19:31
if I'm if I'm if I am um if I am already executing I do if I'm writing if I'm
19:36
reading something for the state of reading and I want to execute I can do uh uh I can do a filter a read filter uh
19:46
a root a read flash a root flash represent idea of one over two one over
19:52
two um one few me 512 bytes of data and The flash will be the sending of the
19:59
information. So that'll be one hop one hop uh right one hop right one hop right
20:07
one hop right to execute. But if I'm already reading um that'll be one if I'm already right. write one right note is
20:15
reading I have to have two hops to um execute one
20:21
making a total of um if I'm if I'm reading and I want to execute another platform system uh and that will be uh
20:28
the um so one so more for me will be one hop one hop
20:35
one hop uh left one hop left uh one hop left and uh uh if I'm reading
20:43
And uh and my last my last operation was execute. My last my last mission was an
20:48
execute. Uh and then if I'm if I'm if I'm if I'm reading and my last operation
20:54
was a right. So that two hubs uh right um if my hub I use a function function.
21:02
So mathematically this is the correct way to do it. So you have to have uh a a
21:09
filter and a flash. So the flash is the sending of information or the execution
21:15
order the flash. So flash can be the organization of the center. So the flash will be uh one hop left um and one hop
21:22
left two hops left maximum two uh left hops
21:29
to um two left hops. Um based on the current state of the system uh maximum
21:36
two left hops uh maximum uh and one hop
21:41
minimum one hop minimum. So one one hop um uh uh one hop in the worst case uh
21:49
two hops in the worst case and that worst case will be uh uh two two for the
21:56
two time for the two times the message to be sent to one space allocation. Um
22:01
so so we say two times um the two times will be uh uh two times will be to one
22:07
space will be uh 512 uh 51 um n
22:13
millconds 51 51 uh millconds plus 17 of
22:18
time for each four bytes I have four bytes I've been allocated memory so uh
22:24
for each four bytes of allocated memory the has to be allocated four bytes ahead of time and that four bytes will be uh
22:31
500 512 um 512
22:37
512 * 4 and that'll be 2,48
22:43
24 bytes of data allocated in order in order in a in a in a in in an order in
22:49
sequence order. So the two left hubs are are not serial
22:55
hubs. They are they are they me full maximum and one full hop. They're meant to be split up but the stand as one
23:02
execute um execute equals some execute operations that can be determined a
23:08
state of graphic step. So 512 * 4 which would be 2014 by 20148 bytes of data
23:15
sent over a protoc of three hops over the sequence of three hops.
23:22
So the maximum hop you can have is uh two wait one two one two over two hops
23:30
two hops uh over two hops two hops you get two hops
23:36
you get two hops read um you get two hops you get two hops which are uh two
23:43
uh two uh two two two left hops not right hops two left hops you get on the
23:49
root uh left right uh two left hops two left hops uh to get to the root of
23:56
execute uh and these two left hop can practice with uh 512 bytes of message
24:03
which is 248 bytes of messages over the over two hops over two divided
24:10
by two two hops um but these two hops are not hop you don't have to do this
24:15
hops you have just rotate your dimension so you don't want to do the hops per se you just have to switch the you can't
24:20
just you have to do a content switch. Um so the content switching uh represents to
24:27
the dimension of of of you don't have to do the hops per say you don't have to just do one one one content switch and
24:34
the cont switch just the change of the trade. So if if you're operating on read write execute train you just take the
24:39
state of the choice you so read becomes um your read becomes a right and that
24:44
right is one switch of you have two two hops instead of two hops you have uh two
24:50
rotations of the tree. So the three uh semblance you have to rotate twice uh to
24:55
these are two you just have two two twice which will give you um the message you same message of the message but the
25:02
two is too much um but you know um you can have um a read if you just want to
25:07
execute you just have to um uh change your view to execute uh but execution is not implicit it's explicitly stated as
25:15
two uh two two hops which is two rotations so my execute and your execute
25:21
becomes my right my right and my right and my read and your read becomes my right and my right becomes your execute
25:28
and vice versa. Uh so the the the the dimension of the system uh is preserved
25:34
because the filter which is the the flashing is sent uh because you just um
25:41
um looked away and it sent you just change the angle of the message. You just change what was there. So you can
25:47
have the the the table again which is um two uh one or two R makes one two R two
25:54
read one R. So, so one read operation is on the right and you have one right and
26:00
you get one right and one left operation uh one right uh one right and you get
26:06
one left one so you get a read uh execute so you have table of let me draw
26:12
it here so I don't mess up so let me draw it here
26:18
so you have two main tables of operation you have you have uh uh read or read execute and then um
26:27
uh read uh execute then write uh then write.
26:34
So, so you know if I have a rate I have a right but that means the table the table will be uh uh uh uh uh RXR
26:46
W R no RX RX
26:55
W um RX
27:01
So the three bases you have three bases you have RX X out. She have um read
27:08
read. You have um R write execute
27:15
uh read and you have two vectors of a get right. Get the read
27:22
read right read read uh read
27:29
write right read write execute write execute write
27:36
execute write execute read I have execute right
27:42
read execute right read and then you have
27:48
execute read.
27:54
So basically that's the choice table here uh you get uh read write write
28:00
execute right read read and then you have the last one which is um uh execute
28:07
you have read write execute you have read
28:14
uh uh read execute right um so the uh as you can see the system
28:21
of read execute as you know but you just need you just need two access of it and this access will be a read write execute
28:28
right and execute right these are two uh this is one m you need you know one order you need so this is one order one
28:35
matrix you need so if you get right you get execute if you get execute you get right you get read two reads I can see
28:41
that two reads at the bottom at the bottom of this table here so you get the order right then execute
28:51
right then execute S with this table this m here is a two point true operation this the order so
28:58
the order is on the right so the order is on the far right and that's basically so you get right execute the execute
29:05
right and then read array so you have two reads at the bottom and you can see there's also two read or two right at
29:10
the bottom and that's what gives you one execution order in the framework of you know implicitly implicit one implicit
29:16
execution order for every two uh tables you construct of this so the next one will be um Um uh right don't write. You
29:24
see basically the matrix is 9 by 9 but you're taking the the uh the 3x
29:30
is 2x two uh 3x3 but you're taking a two making a you're making this you're
29:37
taking a you're taking a uh you can take a 3x two matrix to make it to make the
29:43
message um uh to have to have three you can take a 2x3 matrix which is three two
29:50
rows three columns um uh you're going to use them to um going to transpose to uh
29:56
send a message out to you two by two transpose of it. uh but you know um the
30:02
samples of this mission will be let's try it 2x3 will be uh uh uh uh read
30:08
execute execute read write and you get write
30:14
execute uh and you say so you have the uh uh oh this is uh and you get the
30:21
determinant so you have to come determinant so determinations will be uh if same um if they're same the will
30:30
uh uh one / a * b so the so the
30:36
determinance of this for b um this is not determin this this is transpose this you need you need two matrix you need
30:42
two so you have to have the right do this why I need I need I need the right operation um the transpose so the
30:48
transpose of the right operation is what I need to get a determin of so determinant to set the the the bound
30:53
dimension of operation of action order so I do which is 1 / a a d a * D * C * A
31:02
* 1 / A * A * D
31:08
time plus C + B. So one divided by um this kind of matrix
31:14
by calculating the matricum the matrix of determinance of two trident systems you get the execution of system on the
31:21
fly for controlling system or commanding something uh for security concern you know since the launch time I'm going to
31:28
try to do it properly so uh so I have two breeds here so I
31:35
need two right as well so two right as well so two rights would be uh two right would
31:40
Uh two right to be uh uh two right to be
31:53
so right here two right
31:59
so I just two right one matrix um two right at the bottom um as one axis so
32:05
the axis of like um XYZ so this one's on the bottom axis Z so you get Z. So you get um so to get two right so I'm trying
32:12
to find um two right one bottom axis so what's my tree model so we have
32:18
so the problem so you get if I start with right if I start with a um a read
32:24
I get read write execute um write execute if I go to read execute
32:32
I can start with read or I can start with a read execute on write uh as a sequence um read execute Right. So read
32:40
execute write real uh read execute write uh write uh write um write read execute
32:50
u but this is not complete. This is um wrong uh uh to write no this is the wrong one.
32:57
So I need a read write execute. So the reader could be read um write execute
33:03
uh uh write execute read um but I'm trying to find this now
33:11
uh will be uh that's not transfer only for two execute is one access to find so
33:18
basically you can have access of um right anywhere you go but you know I'm going to have it on the bottom on the
33:25
bottom because it doesn't matter the order it just basically can be diagonal two but single what to do. So you know
33:31
um as I go you get uh read write execute as in red and then you get which is
33:37
right read execute you get read execute to
33:42
uh write you get write execute read and get read uh uh execute and then write
33:50
uh write read and then execute right read and execute
33:57
read write execute
34:05
So read, write, execute and then you get read, execute and then write. Uh but
34:11
this is not the B to balance itself out with a access on the bottom. So XYZ
34:16
where the where the where the we have two sequences. You know since I can't
34:22
find can't compute uh so use index index index one
34:29
uh one one uh I mean one zero so the mission is one zero one zero on the x axis and um 01 on
34:37
the y axis and that will give me uh uh 01 01 and 01 on the xaxis as one right
34:45
equation. So the right matrix is right matrix is for one right is here uh one
34:50
zero uh 01 and the read matrix is um um if I start with right oh
34:58
if I start with reading if I uh the the the the
35:04
so if I start with writing and I and I read operation here if I start with reading
35:10
no if I start with reading if I start with reading and I have a
35:15
right operation. So, so if I if I so R sub R
35:21
sub right is um the matrix one comma 0 comma one and the matrix comma the
35:26
matrix um comma comma right is um right is um right is um right um w right read
35:35
right is right sub read is um uh uh um
35:43
uh if I want to read if I want to read right execute we get 012
35:49
0 2 012 02. So the matrix um will go on
35:55
the board now is computed as determin.
36:01
So let me try to here
36:06
one second. Oh here.
36:34
So the the terminal addition is basically a d * bc a * d um but I'm
36:40
looking for 1 / the terminal that will give me the base. So I get the
36:47
so um the the transpose we're doing the frame is 0 0
36:55
so the concept is what by sharing some information if I share the transpose the transpose not the actual matrix the
37:01
transpose so uh so if I share if my so my
37:11
so very important now you understand this some great we have
37:17
r = r
37:22
= r sub w =
37:28
1 0 1 and our sub
37:37
0 2 so So, oh 1 2 one one
37:49
two one.
38:00
So write one two. So most interestingly when you find read operation right
38:06
systems and this is present kind of system of homogeneity because
38:13
there basically you get read to right so this share so this operation there
38:19
between right and this so I'm going to give you so this I'm give the transpose
38:27
the transpose all this transpose to transpose of the read and Right? So I
38:32
put a t at the top uh here. So again rewrite transpose the transpose will be
38:38
uh rewrite t r sub w is equal to
38:48
which include uh one become a zero. So this here so
38:53
get 0 one one zero and this makes why it gives s
39:00
we share. So we share a zero and a one uh but we don't we don't send this we send the right place to be right of t
39:08
right of uh right trans transpose of right to braid right is [clears throat]
39:16
uh one
39:23
two 1 comma 2 0 comma 2 so uh so I send the
39:30
transpose all my measures instead of the actual measures to the system or to compute it dynamically. So you need to
39:36
send it by the way. So you know essentially you get read right then read subt and you get triangle. So trans will
39:44
be 01 uh transpose of um the trans of rewrite will be 01 and that would be 1 0
39:50
0 1 1 0 which is the matrix of x0 x you get the transpose of the y will be 1 2
39:59
02 02 and now you have to now compute the a
40:04
* d uh a * d plus b * c one over the
40:10
determinant of the this matrix you know matrices And the motivation facility to do it
40:16
and the motion will be so I have to write down here somewhere.
40:21
So I'm going to uh raise this on the left. I'm going to execute this problem
40:28
right.
40:34
So what is what is
41:03
good?
41:13
So, so you get um the transpose
41:20
mean a * z. So we get uh 0 * a * uh 0 *
41:26
2 uh where 2 is um uh a * d
41:33
of a * a b a c a * d will be 2 * 0
41:43
uh 2 * 0 uh which *
41:48
uh a * plus other a * d plus uh so yeah sorry so
41:58
plus other a so you get 2 * 0 plus other you need so a * g is this so 2 * 0
42:06
um the transform mat you get 2 * 0 plus 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 and that will give
42:17
you 2 * 0 is 0 2 so a a d is two two two
42:23
two and then we get uh uh a * d
42:31
a * d plus b * 6 no plus b and c
42:40
8 * c uh a and c you know just do one matrix you know let
42:48
me just do one matrix let me So we get uh transition of the trans if I with the
42:55
transpose matrix. So we get uh 0 * 2 is two uh two uh 1 * 2 is 2 uh so 2 * 2 is
43:07
a * j is 2. I wish to transpose two a two comma
43:13
a * d a * d plus b * c + b * c. So 2 +
43:22
uh plus b * c 2 + 2 * 1 uh is two. So you get two
43:32
two and you get a * z a * d which is uh
43:37
a * z again is u uh one. So two a * z
43:44
this one. So this is a * b. So this is B. B is one. Uh A is B. B * 1 * 0. Uh B
43:56
* D 1 * 2 is 2 + 2 uh * 2 *
44:04
8 * D + B. One second.
45:05
Yeah. So when I'm saying to you, [laughter] so you have 2 * 2, 2 * 2 is 4.
45:14
Four, but you got to have four back. So you have uh a * b * c * g. So 2 + 2 is
45:23
four. Four. Let me erase this and put four. Now you're going to get um two
45:29
already. 2 a * d plus b * c. Um, a * 2
45:36
is 0. A * 2 is 2. 2 * 2 * 0 is 0. Um,
45:41
plus 0 * 1. So, so you get one 1 + uh 1
45:47
+ um oh minus 1 -
45:55
1us what? Uh one. So you get so you get one there.
46:04
One one uh one and you get one one minus b + c was it plus I don't know
46:14
yes it's minus minus minus so minus minus minus i minus plus this correct me
46:23
is minus a b minus b plus minus b yes it's minus
46:29
um so one you get a * * b + c which is minus And then that will be a t
46:37
you get for you get one and then a d.
46:42
So if you go to uh B 2 * D 2 * D 2 * 0 is 0
46:53
uh 0 * uh 0 +
46:59
uh a a 2 0 + 1 * 0 + 1 * 0 is uh 0 + 1 2
47:10
* 1 is 2 * d + 2 2 - 2. So this is so
47:16
one two one one twous
47:23
two. So two 1 comma 2 we get c 0 * uh c * c * a * d
47:33
* a is 1 0 * 1 is zero uh then 0 + u uh
47:38
0 * d a * d a * d a * d c + c * c * * 0 and then 0 *
47:51
b * Uh this is 1 * 1 1 * 2 is 2. two and we have um uh one
48:02
more to do. Do 2 * 1 is 2. 2 * 1 -
48:09
2 * 1us um 2 * 1 minus something called
48:17
2 * 1 minus uh a * c
48:23
a * t * b + c 2 - 1
48:29
so 2 so you get 1 2 1 comma 2 2a for the
48:34
matrix and that you consist the share they share the determinant over the system. So the number the matrix one
48:41
comma 2 on the x x1 x01 uh x0 0 x0 0 is
48:46
one uh x01 is two x02 is two 01 is 0
48:51
comma y1 is two and the last one is two. So you get the ab c is one two three
48:58
four or two vectors that's unit at the time two vectors you need a time as one
49:04
two what you looking at so you get the system here of system but this equation
49:10
is here what is the tendant so it's not going to f you because this is just the
49:18
transpose but I'm going to try to transose this from here so let me use let me use my Capital
49:25
for will be um so we get um capital will be write on
49:32
the board here will be green color in green will be
49:40
a * 3 is 3 1 * 2 is 2 2 +
49:45
2 + 2 + 1 * 0 2 - 1 * 0 is
49:53
And you get uh a d a you get u
50:00
uh two uh you get b 0 * 0 is 0 2 * 1 2 * 2
50:09
so you get two zero * b * g [clears throat]
50:17
of 2 is 2 is zero minus minus um
50:26
should be minus two. This is minus should be minus two hereus
50:32
that both two mean the system. So you got to keep the one I meanus
50:39
two which is two 0 * 0 * 1
50:45
0 minus minus 0 * 1
50:54
d a d b minus b minus
51:01
minus 2 * 2= B
51:08
0 * 2 * 2 is 0 * 2 -
51:14
B C uh - 2 *
51:22
2 * 0 so this will be zero here and this will be this show
51:30
there show C C will
51:36
1 * 1 * uh 0 * 0 *
51:46
0 * 0 0 and then 0 * 0 0 * 0 0 * 0 0
51:52
then 0 and then you get 0 * you get d [clears throat]
51:58
which is one 1 time uh z 1 * uh 0 C * A B * C 0 * 2 is 0. So
52:13
C to to ABC C to A and D to C or one to
52:21
be one. So one here, one here you get last one which is J 1 * uh 0 0 * 1 uh 0
52:33
* 1 a 1 * 2
52:39
1 * 2 is two. So you get two. So the missions are u
52:55
so you get one here. So the matrix will be for this one there not show so this
53:01
will be for the transpose of this one. So now the relation between the transpose and the matrix itself. So you
53:06
get this matrix written matrix is 0 one one zero zero uh one uh on the right
53:13
read right matrix on the right 02 one two and you get these two matrices here
53:19
you have one zero one zero which is basically one zero one zero one two uh
53:24
which is the one to determine the share this share uh and you get the transpose has determination which is one uh
53:33
one two two uh which I believe is so but I don't believe is right one something um yeah
53:40
so one two notative two one two one two
53:46
um two two now now we can now operate safely on the system and that
53:54
system so the this is here two
54:00
here arrows here
54:08
to solve the problem but one over so
54:13
the matrix this has to be that because it's determin of matrix
54:20
multiplication so the calcul of the matrix multiply which will be determined
54:25
to be one over the determinant matrix for the matrix to be set and Java is basically
54:31
52 bytes of data uh that will need this kind of matrix of readr execution order
54:37
to send something to control and command something uh which are what interfaces do they control and command. So you see
54:45
control and command on the file system but the training rules the training rules apply here because they have they
54:52
have a shared binary figure. uh so I can I can tell like the message the message
54:58
over the segment of AD BC it's like this so for example if I'm if I'm working on the transpose I can use the verifier the
55:05
verifier is sent I can message like this so basically 512 bytes of data 512
55:11
divided by a D * BC and AD will be um um
55:18
AD * BC will be the matrix there so 512 bytes of data over along the axis of one
55:25
um along the axis of um of of which is um uh uh one
55:34
um 1 + 3 in terms of things. You get a becomes
55:40
bus
55:51
x-axis will be 1 + 1 which is two
55:57
uh divided by two which was uh 512 256
56:02
uh bytes used of data we get uh 0 plus two oh So sorry.
56:08
Um uh u so in the in the in the half term 52 by data divided by two uh 1 + 1
56:16
which is xaxis is two divided by two uh uh uh 1 * 1 you get 512 bytes of data
56:23
divided by two which will be 256. Wait. Oh, wait.
56:32
512 bytes of data divided by two will give you 256 bytes of data which is one
56:37
plus one. And this the um the x-axis um one they have the half system they're
56:44
verifying. So for the system to work they'll be verifying if they're using the normal um the one that was um the
56:51
original which is 25 of data half time. So this proves that they have half verification because two is basically
56:58
[clears throat] um giving you this 256 by data over segments over the segments of the model. So 25* 2 is 512 and um you
57:08
now have the other one which is um 512 divided by two again in the in the in
57:14
the first matrix which will be the read to write and the right to read matrix 200. So if this by rotator in the memory
57:21
of the OBS message OB is O for E for bravo I for indigo N number E for echo X
57:27
for Xray U forella and S for Sarah. So that beally the two bytes to one system
57:33
they hold two memory and you have the half message. So the half message will be the determinant and determinant work
57:39
in three. you have uh x + y. So you see you get
57:44
1 + 3. 1 + 2 is 3. Uh because you get two separate matrices. 1 + 2 is 3. And
57:51
you get uh you get an x of 1 2 and then 2. So you get one. So you get 512
58:01
/ two which will be 20
58:07
512 / 3 uh which is 1 + 2 is 3 which is
58:12
um 177 1170665
58:21
1770 1,00 170 uh 67
58:28
Okay. 512 / 3 will give us 170.6.6
58:36
recurren 17.67 bytes recurrent. But they add up 2 plus
58:44
plus 512 512.
58:52
So you get um again what is what is 17.66 666
58:59
67 plus 512
59:07
divided by divided by uh divided by 4 2 + 2 is 4
59:14
which will give you uh 29 296 so plus 29
59:20
um plus 512 divided by um divided by 72 divided by 4
59:30
which should add up to the message of which should add up to the message of 200
59:36
uh 2 plus 2. So basically the message some of the message which I got here
59:43
which I got here uh right but this I got right here 29 but the same here
59:50
it will give you the other half of the message because other half this how fast the message sends which is
59:57
basically the work done there's potential work and there's potential position do energy to send position to
1:00:03
send a message which like um if you're like a helicopter top and you're going to do a parachute put your energy to
1:00:09
fall down and going to put you down. You having a measurement of gravity which a muon one of 100. So you you have 100
1:00:18
potential energy of someone on the floor to fall down stability factor to fall
1:00:23
down. So the factor of 100 is um as you rise up to the sky you're going to jump that's a potential energy of the work
1:00:29
and the work is basically work of the potential and work of the down work potential and work done. uh which is the
1:00:35
halfway of the pen which is like a quarter of the energy you're gonna have to actually um do in 25
1:00:42
in in ratio of 100 divided by uh 100 divided by four divided by four which
1:00:48
will be 25. So you have 25 um units of energy in potential work and you
1:00:55
energy in potential work. But potential work has a ratio to um uh 3 to so you
1:01:01
have you have 3 to four 3id by four potential and plus to one
1:01:09
over four work done you can act on uh to send a message which is work time
1:01:15
displacement times work times work force times displacement to force an object an
1:01:21
object the polar via uh theta which is the rule of um uh theta angular
1:01:26
momentum. Um, thank you guys. Angular momentum is what I said. Thank you for
1:01:32
watching the video. Uh, like, share if you get the message. Um, that's works the protocol for human rights and
1:01:39
basically use to control using command and control something whilst it's flying the message of Python script because
1:01:46
it's polyglatic. So that mean any language you want but descriping system it is not a full-blown program language.
1:01:52
It's a scripting system. So you can you can stand as a script system. You can connect Python, C any standard script to
1:01:58
the system of a sig uh and sig will run chrome for d as a chrome job but it
1:02:04
works because it's safe um it's safe to run. So the file format is no session
1:02:11
files and no s for november for France um
1:02:19
intent files. Thank you for watching. Now that's going to eat brunch.
