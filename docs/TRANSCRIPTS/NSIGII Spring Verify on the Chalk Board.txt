Okay. Okay. So, this is um so today's date is
0:10
uh the 31st of January 22nd. The time now is midnight on tonight at 1:10 a.m.
0:17
10 minutes past midnight. So, continue the video here.
0:23
But because I'm not tired, so we can have video here. Yeah. So this video is
0:29
basically on the try to verify uh but you don't need to verify this.
0:36
It's not going to do verify. We're going to work on the um the compass system for
0:42
the system because must go somewhere before doing verifier. So we got to get the compass system
0:48
compass system uh for the XYZ cooling system GE system. So you can send it to
0:55
system to uh graphic system. So you can to um three
1:02
people um three people or uh land network. So I need started the board um
1:10
the board is just started here. So So I got the white choke.
1:17
Got the white ch.
1:22
So take the white choke
1:27
green choke today. So put it here. So you get
1:35
so you know um let's start with the topology firstraphy
1:41
first before we start with the actual system. So we got a standard uh P2P
1:47
topology P2P to
1:54
get you got two type of this P2P circle
2:01
you get. So the circle means a node uh it means
2:07
dynamic. So the circle is dynamic the X is think of it as a dressing system. um
2:14
uh uh IP addressing um which is still in the form of
2:19
uh IP addressing problems in in the space of uh but these are just m of
2:25
system for me I use system for local for local
2:31
topology so your friend can read here your friend can read here
2:38
and send us send a message to
2:46
on the Pable G. Notice that the the circle is a dynamic system
2:53
or dynamic circle IP
3:00
context context you get a C IP which is X X. So
3:08
O is O is direct cross is static IP
3:14
static IP. So um first this is the model here. So uh let's get to the the second
3:21
page before we discuss um the next step next step the next model. So this model
3:28
we also got here bus here bus which is basically
3:35
interdependency. Um so get bus like a bus wheel. So you
3:41
get a box wheels. Oh,
4:02
and you get so see as you can see here the circles
4:09
are stuck at this but this cross here is static and this must be knocked over the
4:16
place. So you see the busy has like wheels you get like a um an area here
4:26
you get um where the v the range of the system but you get a new conation this is a triangular model
4:34
the the connect here so uh see um so let me give you a camera close so you get a
4:41
model here for the system you get one more which is a hybrid model
4:47
so this is uh um um sometimes so as you can see here's a peerto-peer a static IP
4:54
and static circle and square so you get um two two static IPs um and one IP so
5:01
you can two ST IP to one you can have two IPs can be uh refresher like a
5:06
virtual IP uh which will be this is D system um in the making so you can get a virtual IP and that's how that works you
5:12
get two ST IPs and then you get model these are the BS on the
5:18
They basically map out of a plan a floor plan. So work on floor plan you can use for a wild wide area network a wide no
5:28
wide if worldwide wide wide like it's sparse.
5:35
It's basically modeled on the um some rough system but the area cover is this kind of triangle here or this triangle
5:42
here but this is basically the physical wires um this has to be here. Yeah. So
5:48
connection here here and here and here and present systems of um the equation
5:54
solving the system. So this will be a computer program a computer program on a computer here if it's a centralized
6:01
computer and this will be a centralized computer this a bus topology. Now get a hybrid model here.
6:10
So the hybrid model will be
6:16
will be this will be this.
6:30
As you can see, as you can see, this is a star. This is two triangles of overlapping. Two
6:36
triangles of two triangles overlapping. uh close the scale. So two you know the
6:44
edges are either can be ident
7:00
and this IP address is called a hybrid version but it's work on the top. So the
7:05
errors are here one two three four five
7:11
the errors are you have six areas of coverage and this mean control so cover
7:17
you always get OS so this is more tomography tomography
7:23
not topology you get topology which is the area perimeter of the area then you get actual area which is the tomographic
7:30
measurement of this you get tomography so we have one two three four five Areas of smaller triangles you can cover
7:37
on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 areas of
7:43
smaller triangles you can cover if you have two available triangles and what they talking about they have coverage
7:48
you have seven total. So number seven is the area of topography area which is for
7:54
service area. You can offer service to people uh via disob
8:08
service operation. So you got a
8:15
service operation obsess
8:27
um
8:38
so the service are here already. So one less what? So what? So how does this
8:43
works? As mentally this works by um the verify box informally by creating a yes
8:51
no uh um yes no maybe Friday which means what is this message? What do yes no
9:00
maybe? Yes, no or maybe. Try that. So we try
9:06
this is Cisco or RCO. Now Cisco is a bottom up execution order and risk is uh
9:13
risk is trying to check who's like a risk is such like a Cisco or risely
9:19
um um old um which is top down resolution for 70 languages
9:26
if you want to um
9:31
I think so you get uh the shape of you get here So you get uh yes no maybe
9:40
as triangles here you see so this is compass the compass. So in the compass
9:46
you have uh flash sequence and the flash
9:51
works like this. You remember the old chaos model we had in last video. Um they have um they have four um four
10:01
states to resolve to four four resultant uh states order or chaos order and
10:07
chaos. So you have filter and flash. So
10:12
you have filter define it properly. So a filter is a source filter is a function filter is
10:21
any algorithm that that sorts data but does not mutate
10:27
the data mut. So you can have sort
10:32
salt and never mutate never mutates
10:38
results. So the result is salt organization
10:44
does and the flash the flash the flash does opposite a flash mutate mutate the
10:50
results mutation but think of fusion results that's fis
10:58
flash sequences are happening in your computer what's the processing so
11:04
processing order is cisco now get cisco c i F O which is bottom up
11:13
bottom up uh bottom up execution order
11:20
which is like a execution order which is basically NASA NASA NASA that's why
11:28
NASA uses this and you get which is the old shirt which
11:34
are the older one like top down top down top down execution
11:41
to run. So this is what assembly uses the instruction set to go assembly
11:48
instruction set. So um now you get
11:53
the order by Python by Python. So by Python the B system is basically a
12:00
promise of future in Python future language. Yeah, Python order.
12:06
It's a promise that's um that doesn't doesn't append. It doesn't have pending.
12:12
It doesn't have a promise that's resolved because the so you get if you get a promise library um feature library
12:20
you can work with futures but they have a pending state have a yield state. So
12:25
user is dynamic. So you know this is resolve itself. This is sticking. So user bally has the system has some
12:32
default that resolve the state. So the are classifiers. So um so you get to bypass
12:40
ordering this which is by um order
12:45
you get order you have chaos and the chaos result of a system uh of a systems
12:55
trident which can be examples here.
13:00
So you have triangle
13:06
triangle here. to try and put the product here. So you have this compass
13:12
here a compass here but you can't see it's a new compass. So you have
13:20
you know compass has a direction. So this is just this point the compass and
13:26
the compass represent kind of the model using for the order. So you know to mitigate order let's be case among the
13:33
system. So if I have if I'm this comp is rotating spinning this needle this
13:38
needle compass where is this order happening. So you have four to one state
13:43
of the system and that's basically based on the system of natural entropy around the world you know um get from nothing
13:51
can mean something that we don't really know it mean something based on our frame of reference
13:57
example we have um uh no signal no we
14:03
have the mucus which is like noise which means noise means u the system is uh be
14:10
destroyed by this. We have no we have no information information we're getting
14:16
just getting noise random data count of mean too much information too little too
14:21
little data too too much and get noise you get um noise
14:29
you get noise so the system is equally
14:40
a clear picture so Noise is no noise but this noise has to be ordered by order
14:46
you get noise you get no noise you get no signal.
14:54
So this is the trial here. you get no signal and if you can keep control all of this um this system um no signal that
15:03
means you can have signal which is so channel you're not connected to someone
15:09
channels here is noise and no signal and the pattern order has organizes into
15:16
categories so we can always have a clear picture and that picture is signal which
15:22
is like a computer graphics interface um signal So this ensures no locker no
15:28
locker. So signal signal means like you are using computer and stabilization
15:34
signal and signal means like you are using so
15:39
no you get lock out. So we get signal get lock out no lock out. So this is the
15:45
lock out problem really. So the spring when the spring comes into
15:51
place you know um is you know am I having a clear picture of the message you know the spring basically works on
15:58
the kind of system of low signal transition you have noise here and you
16:04
have noise on the root on the top and the tip of the lever and you have on the right you have no noise and you have um
16:13
no signal on the right to make signal but So you can think of
16:19
you can think of this um um uh uh system as u either filters um the the the the
16:30
order as filters. So you get one filter which is order and the filters are are
16:35
to see less and see more see more. Basically the filters are just the
16:41
things you apply to the needle to to get the receiver. So the filters are
16:46
basically um so you have two filters. You have one other filter, you have one filter and the filters basically are by
16:53
Python. So you can switch around to have to see um where the point where
17:00
compass points to. So the goal of this to have that has no lockout and the
17:05
system that has no lock but lock means the lock out. So there's
17:12
no account here. They never lock you out.
17:20
So that that works before. So it's
17:26
basically a system of soy. How would this work?
17:33
This would be the same as having yes, no or maybe consensus. But you know we have
17:40
to bypass over uh you know yes no maybe can use say you understand this but the
17:47
rule is no. So we have this we have this yes no maybe because you know thisly the
17:52
replaces do and this is one yes no consensus the r consensus offset view.
17:59
So compos does the job properly. So let me get closer to it. Let me show you what you're doing. So we talked about
18:06
the bipart we talk about the chaos ordering and how the filters two filters for two two
18:14
bypass one bypass filter. So you can switch one byp one tripod one B you have
18:22
noise signal signal and this is the compass searching searching space for the needle
18:27
which can dictate the result of devices and via the topology toography of the
18:33
state of the hybrid architecture and this should work. So the goal of this is to resolve the system perfectly.
18:40
So we're not going to go to the math now math side of it things but you know just take the visual down a filter you get a
18:46
filter which is again uh uh um you know it doesn't change the resultant it just
18:53
um the the state of the state or data of the program it doesn't change it doesn't
18:58
change one thing keeps the same keep the same and keeping data and the state of the program does the filter and you get
19:05
the misses one or the other pure function that does one or the But it doesn't mean you the result of it either
19:11
of that system. Um you get flash storing like you know it stores one thing and
19:16
not other present which is basically the quantum system
19:23
flash modeling here quantum filing. So you get a Cisco risco bottom up
19:30
execution order risco instruction set um uh top down execution order and you can
19:37
bypass the order. So I'm going to put this here.
19:42
So run now. So now I'm going to uh erase this now just to work.
20:13
Buzz over here. So, you know, uh uh if you want
20:34
So the last I want to show you today is how it work and that will be via the
20:41
local secret. Um so how this work? So normally because
20:47
it works like this. It works like a yes no maybe system. We try this system just
20:52
determine how verifies. So the verifiation needs
20:59
spring. So you get my remember you get net force
21:05
= 1 / net force of 1 /x = - x. Net force
21:12
of x = k. Um the integral the integral
21:19
of um of of 0 to 2x is defined as
21:26
the seeant
21:33
seeant over time paper.
21:39
So
21:46
just remember
21:54
to half one.
22:10
So 1 / e when this exponent uh uh 1 e to the power of n
22:19
/ 2 3.
22:26
So you get two. So you get the two equations you have. So you get the next
22:33
force = to 1 /x=ative k. Nowative k just to remember guys
22:41
negative k means negative kinematics negative negative force you know force
22:46
in the opposite direction and that force is kinematic force. So you get 1 /x 1 /
22:52
x is the the force in direction. This force has a relationship to this force K which is the force in one one
22:59
works on XYZ axis you know so you get a one half of the force 1/2 of the force
23:07
which will mean 12 * D 1/2 * D
23:14
uh U where U is the unit and D is the uh derivative of U. So one half where is
23:22
the unit? So the unit is one one
23:27
uh for the second but we need a ratio. So one half of the ratio um is uh one
23:34
half of the ratio is um half you get um 1/2 we get this one half is
23:42
one half of a pull force of a push and a pull force um z work done. So the work
23:48
done equation is what we need is work equals displacement
23:54
time force and force equals
23:59
mass timeation. So you know because I can't find the document my working out before you know this individual is I
24:08
can't I can't open my lap if I can I'll pause it and check it out. Let me try it
24:13
actually. Let me try it actually. Let me try to pause my live stream. Uh yeah, I'm not
24:19
going to shoot it live. I thought it was so you see what I'm saying? So you know
24:26
what I'm saying? Um so let me try to find my video
24:34
on the system of um yeah. So orbit no
24:40
play chess. So we get so we get um force um we get
24:48
um integral of fu uh given du uh cosine
24:55
um uh u over sin u g the force u. So the
25:00
integral of the force u is the potential equation and this would be the um potential
25:08
equation you get 1 / e. So so I get it now. So I know I'm working on now. So So let
25:15
me just finish this now. Um so you get
25:23
so you get Thank you Monday. Thank you.
25:31
So you get the potential equation of the integral is 1 /
25:38
so you get this y = displace time space of displacement time force
25:44
and this force is the essential but now you get this equation here so you get other equations too and they are
25:54
uh the potential P
26:00
The potential P the potential P E potential of P the
26:06
potential of um the potential of um so the work potential of a displacement D
26:13
uh so you get um two type of work you get work of potential work and you get um uh work done you get work done work
26:21
um displacement as false but if you get potential work you get a ratio to displacement so you get um the work
26:26
displaced u but the work is working if divide by F you get you get
26:34
so you divide by F so for by S you get so so
26:40
to get um displacement by itself you have to do work divided by F and that to
26:48
which displacement of the system. So this is what you need but you get two type of displacement. You get potential
26:54
displacement uh you get two type of you get potential displacement and relative
26:59
displacement. So you get um you get um absolute displacement you get potential dis you get sorry you get absolute
27:06
displacement absolute and potential and the relative displacement. Um but the model is
27:13
basically um for modeling uh potential um potential work
27:19
or like you know if you're in if you're in a helicopter you jump in off the helicopter and you get potential work and you get potential work get potential
27:25
energy like um if you're in about to jump you don't just jump you just have to fall down to get you get potential
27:32
energy and um uh uh non-p potential energy um so you get um energy that just
27:40
um in the Of course you have to add energy somewhere like you know if if
27:46
you're already in gravity you have to keep the orbit around the gravity if you can't maintain the orbit then you have
27:51
to add more work to maintain that orbit. Uh and so so work force displacement. So
27:58
this function this for this kind of formula here uh work equals work divided
28:03
by force equals displacement is that has two type of potential and potential and
28:09
non potential work displacement um to determine the potential work down um
28:14
because they're related to work and given the force um related to work which is work force displacement
28:23
force. So we get this formula here already. Now this one we have the uh
28:28
potential uh the potential
28:35
to get the potential uh you get the non potential work potential
28:42
you get the displacement that's um the displacement n but I'm going to write this down I'm going to write what I have here so we get potential we're going to
28:49
have so we're going to have the integral you get because my video is very long so you get you get Um the integral x o zero
28:58
f u fa u uh d u
29:04
d sorry d circle sorry guys
29:15
we do uh uh integral of x to f U
29:24
D C S C sine
29:31
U. So we get um the integration not the lapis integration uh of a of a force of
29:39
a unit and the unit is basically um the unit of um uh work force or uh and
29:47
displacement only. You need that to which is half the half the system. So
29:54
you get half um of so you get the force unit of displacement. You get uh force
30:01
um which is over a unit displacement derivative of derivative of um of
30:06
coseant over the sign of of of the units which is the unit measurement of the xy
30:14
d axis via soa. Uh so you get a system there, you get a system here, you get
30:21
force equals uh system here. So you get a system here. So the potential equation of the
30:28
system is system. You know this equation determines how much um how much how the
30:34
integration of a potential system scales um via lapis rule. So this is very
30:39
important for me to have in your mind guys. So you get now get the potential equation which is 1 / e. So you get
30:44
potential which you get 1 / e. So 1 / E * this is this what it mean. So this is
30:51
the force F. F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F F is a force of unit U where U is a force being acted some some kind
30:58
of object being acted upon and you get cosine over S coseant over coseant of
31:06
the unit over S of the unit which is just coseant divided
31:12
by seeant U where share the same unit as input uh via lambda reduction. Um this
31:19
is the what's in the unit. So this is what's on base reduction. Um it's the
31:24
same resource once one and you then finally get and you get finally get the system of
31:32
the resource itself nonlinearly because
31:37
because um f times um sorry guys because
31:42
1 / e uh time um uh time kx
31:48
uh to the power of e 1 / * t
31:56
all the way when I put e^
32:06
So for this result itself you have e to the power e * k of x
32:14
uh yeah so you get 1 / I wrote it down improperly I think yeah
32:20
so you now have the e 1 / k e * k of x.
32:28
Um so you get uh one over e. So you get one over 1 / k
32:35
1 / k * e to the power 1 / k 1 / k 1 / k
32:41
1 / x um 1 /x uh where x is the input of the share the
32:48
share 10% ratio of between e and x. That be 1 over e. I put e here should be
32:54
an x. kx * kx.
33:01
Oh, I put one e. So 1 / e is the exponent of the system. You know the
33:06
more system 10% um the more one eid e
33:11
say 1 e will be the threshold of the force. So the maximum of e. So e will be
33:18
an exponent. So 1 / e is correct I believe in my board view. So I'm proud of it. One over e. So let me just put
33:25
this one over e here. Stop now.
33:30
One divided by
33:37
1 / by
33:42
1 / e 03 uh 678
33:50
1 to 0.0.3 2.3 67 9
33:58
3 * K and K is the kinematics. So you get two K you get 1 / X which minus K
34:05
you get X which is just system for this one E
34:10
termin
34:15
is a one E. So it's 10% stable but it's the inverse. So you get one divided by E
34:23
but this one t something that's going so you know going
34:30
inside. So what inver is the inverse of the system that you're pulling back you know you're holding the potential this
34:37
potential is what you can hold between we can we can send we can push and pull
34:42
uh we put this 0 um uh 0 367 uh 8 and
34:49
then 1 / e time k is the so k is if k is
34:55
uh k is uh uh is the force acting on X is uh
35:04
uh uh 45° 45 uh the force
35:10
uh is force is uh the force is uh the
35:15
force of X for X force of the force unit X is
35:21
by D which is K d is K d is K uh uh
35:28
uh let's say 45 45 um
35:35
um over 100 uh 0.45 0.45
35:41
and now times 0.45 uh 0.45 four five uh so you get one over
35:50
1 e * k * k or d or g
35:57
or d um * x
36:08
times
36:17
Uh 0.3 0.3679
36:24
* 45°. So 30 * 45 will be
36:30
um uh 45 watt 0.45. So times 0.45 45 *
36:37
045 is 0.166 1 6655
36:45
166 0 1 66
36:53
55 55 and this is the kind of spaces you
36:59
get the force. So you have a force. So by the force
37:04
will be the force force force but one e is the ratio that's between so if I just
37:12
want to do I can compute the inverse y which is the y so now I have 1 / e the
37:18
force I have the ratio of um of 0.166.166
37:28
oh 0.16554 4 554
37:36
and that was what I sent uh with the system of messages but you know so so
37:42
the verifiable will have this potential energy um and that I have half of that so half of that energy will be so this
37:49
is 10% stable 10% stable uh if I have half of this message half
37:56
of the half of them this will be I um should be so basically 10% should be
38:03
4.5 so this is 1% stable it's not really good so it should be so if using 45 I
38:10
should be using um 45 using 10% of 45 which should be 4.5 so that would be 4.5
38:17
times the kinematics time 4.5
38:22
so that be 4.5 times the time x divided
38:29
by x uh which is 4.5 x should be 4.5 uh
38:34
divided by x of b 0.45 and um is 10% 5 so that 4.5 * x
38:44
um whatever uh was x
38:50
so you half of the system half of
38:58
I made a mistake but you know I learned from my mistake so you know so I'm going to write it up on a good note but do you
39:05
know here come with me so I get half
39:10
1 / 2 * x and x is um um
39:18
uh uh uh 0.5 so x is 0.5 so one e so
39:23
half of the w will be uh minus k. So we get uh times 45 divid by 100
39:32
* 45 / by uh 10 for 10% stability which will
39:38
give you 4.5 0.5 * 4.5 will give you 2.25. So the 22 stable so 2.25 is what
39:46
you get. But this message is basically um what you say to verify ring. So for
39:51
this to work properly you're going to have 2.25 25 already there for 10%
39:57
by 10.5. So that you have 2.25 and the 2.25 will have something else and
40:04
altitude and that last one will be uh the one which will be uh divided by uh
40:12
which will be the coseant of uh the coseant over the s of u uh which is 45.
40:23
uh because you do 10%. So that mean so we times times the coseant
40:33
just um cosecant will be 25.4713
40:38
divided by the sign
40:44
uh which should be 0.8416 8416 0
40:49
uh um and the unit is basically um 45 degrees. So we get 45 4.5 divided by 45
40:58
divided by of the of the of units of two times times unit times unit of 45. So
41:05
times use of 45 will be uh yeah so you get the ratio um so you
41:13
get divided by no divide you have to have divided by
41:19
the unit of yeah so basically because so again it
41:24
was 4 to 5 / 10 10% stable 45id by 10 4.5 times times times uh
41:35
times u time um times 1 / e
41:42
times uh time by 10 / 10 times the um which is the which is
41:51
the displacement of the system we get times or so get the force the force
41:56
equals work so we get the force the force is basically um the work so work
42:02
by force work is so the work is basically Basically the integration of the work is basically the potential. So
42:09
times times the integral of coseant
42:15
of u but u is not defined the force of u. force is basically times the coseant
42:21
of the force which is uh um um okay times the cosecant which is um 12.745
42:30
which is coseant which is the integration over the cosecant over over the over the area coseant um divided by
42:38
sid by um the divided by the s of u sine of
42:46
s of u which is 4.5 so 4.5 5 / sin of u
42:52
which is 4.5 which is um 0 0
43:00
divided by the sign of oh let me go back again
43:06
z so which is um um um
43:14
uh uh 4.5 which is 68 8 point uh 3 point
43:20
uh one 8.15
43:26
um 111 7511 uh 1 141
43:33
stop working guys so basically you see the integation has worked so I'm going to give go you know you have to take
43:40
this ination formula as for notice so you have the force u the force of units
43:47
which is basically due to the whole system uh which like 45° 45
43:56
over the unit. So um sub the units 45 45 you get 4.5 4.5
44:03
but you know over the ratio of 45. So this is 10% stability factor. Thank you guys for watching my video.
